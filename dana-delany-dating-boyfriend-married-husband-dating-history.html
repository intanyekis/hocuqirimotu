Apart from building a successful career, what they usually wish for is to hitch with one nice guy who loves and adores her for life. But, this thing is not compulsory for all girls and ladies.

Although she does not look forward to marrying someone, she do want to date people. She added that she loved dating but not marrying.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Dana_Delany%E2%80%99s_Dating_History></span>Dana Delany’s Dating History!<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As mentioned earlier, <a href=#>Dana</a> does not want to tie the knot but she looks forward to date.
