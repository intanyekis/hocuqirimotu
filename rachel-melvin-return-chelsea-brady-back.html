It looks like Peacock released the wrong Days of Our Lives episode this morning, posting the Monday, September 4 one, instead of Monday, August 28!

But jumping ahead a week wasn’t the real kicker — that came when eagle-eyed viewers reported that they’d spotted Rachel Melvin in the show’s credits!</p><p>“They released next Monday’s episode by mistake,” Semaj DeBose tweeted, “and actress Rachel Melvin was in the credits as Chelsea.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>They released next Monday's episode by mistake and actress Rachel Melvin was in the credits as Chelsea</p><p>— Semaj DeBose (@Fitzandlivlove) <a href=# rel=nofollow>August 28, 2023</a></p><p>“PS,” abetterlizard (OK, we’re kind of fascinated by that name) tweeted, “Rachel Melvin is in the credits for next week.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>PS, Rachel Melvin is in the credits for next week. <a href=# rel=nofollow>#Days</a></p><p>— Liz ※ (@abetterlizard) <a href=# rel=nofollow>August 28, 2023</a></p><p>And that news makes a ton of sense! Chelsea is one of the characters we were hoping <a href=# rel=noopener>would return for Victor’s funeral</a>, seeing as how she was his granddaughter through Bo and Billie.</p><p>Melvin debuted in the role in 2005 after Mandy Musgrave had originated it a year earlier. Though introduced as Abigail’s troublemaking friend Chelsea Benson, it was eventually revealed that Billie and Bo were her real parents. She did not have an easy time of it either, from clashing with her mom (and by that we mean spiking recovering alcoholic Billie’s drink) to accidentally killing her half brother, Zach, in a hit and run.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/JPI_Episode10862_73916-e1691593970149.jpg alt='John Aniston, Peggy McCay, Rachel Melvin "Days of our Lives" Set NBC Studios Burbank, Ca. 6/5/08 ©Paul Skipper/jpistudios.com 310-657-9661 Episode # 10862' width=1024 height=599 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Eventually, of course, she made peace with her parents and was last seen in 2009, leaving for London to help Billie recover after a car accident.
