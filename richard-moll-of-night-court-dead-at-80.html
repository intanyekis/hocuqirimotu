He was 80 years old, and according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a>, a rep for the family confirmed he died at home on October 26 in Big Bear Lake, California. He famously played “Bull” Shannon, the super-tall bailiff with a shaved head, on the show from 1984-1992, and was known for his comedic refrain of “Ohhh kay.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>Richard was best known for his role on the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Emmy-nominated NBC sitcom</a>, but he was a prolific actor in both voice and screen work. His height often dictated the nature of his roles. In 1977, he played Mormon Church founder <strong>Joseph Smith, </strong>a historical figure known to have physical stature, in Brigham. &nbsp;In the comedy flick <i>Caveman, </i>he played the abominable snowman, and a cyclops in an episode of <i>Hercules: The Legendary Journeys.&nbsp;</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/richard-moll-dead-ss-EMBED.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Over the years, his shaved head also turned out to be part of his identity. After he rocked a bald head specifically for his role in 1983 sci-fi movie&nbsp; Metalstorm: The Destruction of Jared-Syn,&nbsp;he wound up keeping it that way. In a 2010 interview, he divulged that producers had asked him to again shave it after an audition for Night Court.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“They said ‘Richard, the shaved head looks good. Will you shave your head<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> for the part</a>?” he recounted at the time. “I said, ‘Are you kidding? I’ll shave my legs for the part. I’ll shave my armpits, I don’t care.'”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>He wound up an unforgettable part of the sitcom, and<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> starred alongside 80s</a> icons <strong>John Larroquette</strong>, <strong>Markie Post</strong>, and <strong>Harry Anderson</strong> for 192 of 193 episodes. He also appeared in episodes of T.J. Hooker,&nbsp;Alice, B.J. and the Bear,&nbsp;and The Dukes of Hazzard,&nbsp;among others.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>He was married twice — to <strong>Laura Class</strong> and <strong>Susan Brown</strong> — and leaves behind two children and two stepchildren.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH5xe5FwZquhk52us7CMpqalpF2ks266yKCfrWWTpMKzwIydnJqcXZbBboSPaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
