The entire performance reportedly cost the hotel $24 million, which concluded with a dramatic fireworks display.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Internet Is Making Fun Of Kim Kardashian’s Spending Habits</a></span></p><p>Aside from Beyoncé’s paycheck, one of the most expensive parts of hosting the singer may have included her hotel stay.</p><p>The Atlantis put her up in a penthouse suite, specifically what they refer to as the Royal Mansion. The condo features over 12,000 square feet of living space, including 2 stories as well as 4 bedrooms.</p><p>The penthouse is able to accommodate up to 9 people, with King and Queen sized beds in each bedrooms. The bathrooms are stocked with Hermès products. Even the entrance of the penthouse is spectacular, as it’s lined with 100-year-old olive trees and sky-high ceilings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The nightly rate may be expensive, but the penthouse is so luxe that everything is completed in-suite. There’s 24-hour room service as well as a butler service that will come directly to the condo. Guests can also opt to have spa services done in the penthouse, as it’s even equipped with a functioning steam room.</p><p>Of course, guests can also enjoy the luxurious amenities the hotel offers. With more than 790 rooms, the hotel features the largest jellyfish aquarium in the world, a water fountain that includes a fire element, and 17 luxurious restaurants and bars to try out.</p><p>Beyoncé was likely treated like royalty during her stay in Dubai in addition to receive a million-dollar paycheck.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, the singer’s concert wasn’t without controversy. Critics slammed Beyoncé for agreeing to perform in Dubai given the country’s harsh stance on homosexuality and women’s rights.</p><p>In fact, The Guardian reports that while Beyoncé played 19 songs during the performance, including a duet with her eldest daughter, 11-year-old Blue Ivy, she <a href=#>didn’t play any material from her 2022 album Renaissance</a>.</p><p>It's speculated she did so because Renaissance is widely interpreted as a love letter to the Black and Queer community, so the music may have not been welcomed at the Dubai concert.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite the backlash, Beyoncé’s team never responded to the controversy over her Dubai concert.
