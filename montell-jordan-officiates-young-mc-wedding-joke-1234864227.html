According to <a rel=nofollow href=#>TMZ,</a> the two musicians, who have been longtime friends, shared the moment on Sunday (March 24).</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“People should see your marriage and know that God is real, and that’s why we’re here today,” detailed the<a href=#> R&B singer-turned-pastor</a> to the couple before moving into a <a href=#>non-traditional call</a> for objections in footage shared by the tabloid.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Please feel free to leave now,” joked the Los Angeles native to guests after the bride delivered the cutthroat gesture. “This is how we do it,” he continued as the witnesses laughed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-136265521.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">According to the outlet, Young MC married his longtime girlfriend Chantal in an <a href=#>intimate ceremony</a> in Scottsdale, AZ., surrounded by friends, family, and fellow artists. Guests included Tone Loc, C+C Music Factory’s&nbsp;Freedom Williams, and members of the band All-4-One.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The veteran rapper is best known for his 1989 hit “Bust A Move” which was featured on his debut album Stone Cold Rhymin’. The song took home the trophy for Best Rap Performance at the 32nd annual GRAMMY Awards in 1990. Young MC also co-wrote&nbsp;Tone Loc’s&nbsp;two hit records, “Wild Thing” and “Funky Cold Medina.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I had extra pressure because, by the time I’m making this, ‘Wild Thing’ is already platinum. People are talking to me, saying, ‘Why didn’t you do that song?’ But I had no intent of doing ‘Wild Thing.’ That was Tone’s — I made it for Tone; I wrote it with Tone’s voice in mind — but having said that, I played a part in a record that was so big, I’m hoping that someone even&nbsp;listens&nbsp;to my song,” reflected Young MC on the origin of “Bust A Move” to <a rel=nofollow href=#>SPIN</a> in April 2023.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“It’s slower. It’s not rock. It’s more R&B… is it going to cross? It’s got the woman singing in it. It doesn’t have rock guitars in it. ‘Funky Cold Medina’ was breaking around that time as well. So I’m seeing both of those records do what they did with the sounds that they had, and my record sounded so much different, and it was slower. I’m like, ‘Uh-oh. Hopefully something can happen here.'”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6K8r8DEpaNmop%2BnsaK6jKidn6GTnq61sdJmsKitnpx6rq%2BMsJydnJmjtG62zqScZmliaIF5gpNraXBn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
