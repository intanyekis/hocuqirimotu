He is an actor and singer, best-known for his role as Frisco Jones in the drama General Hospital.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Peter John Wagner II, A Multi-Talented Star</h2><p>Peter John Wagner II was born on October 3, 1959 in Washington, Missouri. His family was deeply religious, and he was reared as a devout Catholic.</p><p>Wagner was a music enthusiast as a child&nbsp; and his love for music increased day by day. He’d been playing guitar since he was 14 years old.</p><p>He went to St. Gertrude’s parochial school for his studies and he later enrolled into St. Francis Borgia Regional High School where he completed his education.</p><p>Wagner was so much into sports, so when he was in school, he participated in many sports such as basketball and football.</p><p>He spent a year at the University of Missouri, then went to&nbsp; junior college. Then he transferred to the University of Arizona. He tried out for the golf team and theater department while being a student.</p><p>John Wagner hit the jackpot when his university’s theater department granted him a full scholarship. Then, he graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree.</p><p>He has acquired significant acclaim not just as an exceptional stage actor and singer, but also as a scratch golfer. He has won six club titles at his home course in Los Angeles, The BelAir Country Club.</p><p>Wagner has also won the American Century Celebrity Golf Championship twice. Wagner topped the tournament for the first time in 2006.</p><p>He returned as the winner in 2011, defeating Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo. He’s finished in the top 10 nineteen times.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>In his Professional Life</h2><p>In 1982, he made his acting debut as Clint Masterson in the short-lived TV soap opera A New Day In Eden.</p><p>Wagner’s most well-known character was Frisco Jones on General Hospital from 1983 to 1988, 1989 to 1991, and 1994 to 1995. Wagner was expected to return to GH in February 2013 also.</p><p>He made his name with Kristina Wagner, who played Felicia in the soap opera, and the on-screen couple became a power couple.</p><p>Playing rocker Frisco Jones in General Hospital led him to sing songs for the soap opera, which prompted a multi-album partnership with Quincy Jones’ Warner Bros.</p><p>Wagner also starred as Warren Lockridge in Santa Barbara from 1991 until the show’s end in 1993. He starred in many made-for-TV movies, such as Moving Target, Lady Killer, Frequent Flyer, and Dirty Little Secret.</p><p>He starred as Nick Marone on the CBS daytime drama The Bold and the Beautiful from 2003 until 2012.&nbsp;</p><p>Wagner received a Daytime Emmy award for “Best Younger Actor” for his role in the soap opera General Hospital in 1985.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2005, John was also nominated for “Best Lead Actor” for his role in The Bold and the Beautiful.</p><p>Wagner participated in season 14 of Dancing with the Stars in 2012, partnering with professional dancer Anna Trebunskaya.

However, he has six studio albums to his credit.</p><p>When it comes to music, John Wagner has made his imprint just as much as he has in the realm of the drama industry.</p><p>With the song “All I Need,” Wagner hit the Billboard charts in 1985.

It was around this time that Kristina was pregnant for the first time with son, Peter.&nbsp;</p><p>They tied a knot at Lake Tahoe in 1993 at a small wedding chapel. Despite the fact that Kristina and Jack had their second son, Harrison, in 1995, their 13-year relationship was fraught with difficulties.</p><p>The couple called it quits and filed for a divorce after experiencing irreconcilable disagreements, and it was confirmed in 2006.</p><p>However, the ex-couple, Wagners, have two children together. Harrison was born in 1994 and Peter was born in 1990. In 2011, he also reconnected with his biological daughter Kerry at a concert.</p><p>Mother of Kerry had put her up for adoption when she was born, so she went in search of her original parents.</p><p>In 2007, Wagner fell in love and started dating Heather Locklear from Melrose Place.

He’s relapsed and is MIA for five days,” said Jack.</p><p>The two brothers posed for a photo on Peter’s Instagram a few weeks before Harrison’s tragedy.

YOU are left with YOU and your thoughts.”</strong></p><p>He usually posted his pictures on IG account with motivational and positive captions.
