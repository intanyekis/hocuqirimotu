The rapper is now the owner of a Bugatti Veyron Chiron Super Sport, which he was photographed driving around in on Tuesday in Brentwood, California.</p><p>According to <a href=#>TMZ</a>, the Bugatti Veyron starts at around $3.5 million. But with a variety of custom additions, Travis’ ride cost him a cool $5.5 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Perrie Edwards Is Engaged & Her Ring Is Worth Half A Million Dollars</a></span></p><p>The Bugatti Veyron is exceptionally rare, with only 30 models made. “To mark the sensational record-breaking run that exceeded the magical threshold of 300 miles (482,80 km) per hour for the first time, Bugatti proudly presents the Chiron Super Sport 300+,” <a href=#>the car manufacturer says</a> of the esteemed model.</p><p>“Limited to 30 units, this very special edition of the Chiron is visually and technically inspired by the record-breaking vehicle,” Bugatti continues.</p><p>Travis went on to tease the car on his social media. He posted an image of himself in the driver’s seat with the sports car’s blue interior on full display.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This isn’t the only impressive model in Travis’ collection, though it may be the most expensive. <a href=#>He also reportedly owns</a> a Ferrari Laferrari Aperta (valued at $3 million), a Mercedes Maybach G650 Landlaut Custom (valued at $1.6 million), and a Lamborghini Urus Mansory Venato Custom (valued at $600,000).</p><p>With a net worth of approximately $50 million, Travis can certainly afford the luxury rides. But his purchase may be surprising given the $10 billion lawsuit hanging over his head.</p><p>In January, it was reported that all of the lawsuits stemming from the Astroworld Festival tragedy are <a href=#>valued at over $10 billion combined</a>. The lawsuits are also naming Apple Music, Live Nation, NRG Stadium, and Drake in addition to Travis.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Travis founded Astroworld in his hometown of Houston, Texas in 2018, and has annually headlined the festival since its creation. However, the 2021 edition took a fatal turn when a crowd surge left dozens dead and hundreds injured.</p><p>Travis received immediate backlash following the tragedy. He was criticized for continuing to perform despite the crowd surge and for attending an afterparty following the event. He was also accused of encouraging a riot on social media.</p><p>Additionally, the festival’s organizers were also accused of not implementing adequate safety measures.</p><p>The lawsuits remain ongoing. Nevertheless, they haven’t appeared to have dimmed Travis’ star power. The rapper <a href=#>has performed multiple events and concerts</a> since Astroworld, and has even <a href=#>booked his first festival appearance</a> for later this year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Bill Cosby Ordered To Pay $500,000 To Assault Victim</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>TMZ</a>, <a href=#>Bugatti</a>, <a href=#>Autobizz</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e9OrmK%2Bho2LApLvTrWRuZZ2eua21zqdkm62XlsG1tYycn6Kqn6N8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
