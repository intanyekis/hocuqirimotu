But, not long after, the&nbsp;announcement of their breakup turned into another hot take.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The actors’ agencies calmed the media's curiosity regarding the break-up by saying the separation was due to their busy schedules. But was that really the case?</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Beginning And End Of The Romance</h2><p>It is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">known </a>that Min-young and Min-ho fell for each other in the set of the hit K-drama, City Hunter.&nbsp;The former couple’s mesmerizing on-screen chemistry gradually turned into reality and left the K-drama world in awe as the news of them dating surfaced.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The news took the media by storm, which might have been too much for the actors. But, after few months of dating, rumors of their separation began spreading as the actors were not together in award shows and seemed distant from one another.</p><p>The rumor turned out to be true as an official&nbsp;confirmation surfaced in January 2012. Both the actors' agencies&nbsp;confirmed that after the series,&nbsp;they were very busy with their schedules and could not make enough time to see each other, which led them to separate on a friendly note.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>However, the stars had already parted&nbsp;ways long before revealing their break-up to the public. The reason for them holding the news a little longer was to not&nbsp;drag any unwanted attention from the media.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Despite the actors <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">trying </a>to keep their relationship under wraps, it became well-known to all. They were surrounded with overwhelming attention, making it hard to express themselves genuinely in the relationship. So they had to go their separate ways. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Who is Min-young Dating?</h2><p>The 34-year-old star has also been rumored to have been romantically associated with the K-drama actors Park Seo Joon and Ji Chang Wook.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The rumor regarding her dating Park Seo Joon was a buzz topic, although they shared screen back in 2018 for the popular TV series What’s Wrong with Secretary Kim. Some news-hungry reporters tried their best to stir the rumor, but Min-young herself shut-down the buzz as reported by&nbsp;an online <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">source</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The source added that she would not have posted her picture with Park Seo Joon on Instagram if she had planned to keep the relationship a secret, as rumored.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Likewise, her rumor with the actor Ji Chang Wook also ignited after another successful drama, Healer. The drama presents swoon-worthy on-screen romance between the stars, which added fuel to the rumor regarding the stars’ off-screen romantic chemistry. But, no evidence could be found to support the tale.</p><p>Obviously, the actors involved in romantic scenes are usually rumored to be together because of their closeness, as seen on-screen, but that’s not necessarily true every time. And, so goes with Min-young’s dating life.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnoJa%2FrHnMoqVmsZ%2Bqu6h5y56cZqWZo3qpu4ydmK2hnpx6o77EmqJmraBjtbW5yw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
