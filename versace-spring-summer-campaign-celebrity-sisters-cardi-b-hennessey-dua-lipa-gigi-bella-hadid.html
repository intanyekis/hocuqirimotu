Each of the bags comes with&nbsp;the classic Versace medusa symbol alongside gold hardware.</p><p>As per <a href=#>W Magazine</a>, Versace has been pushing a sisterhood theme since January ahead of the collection’s launch. The outlet speculates it may have something to do with the tragic story of Donatella Versace’s sister, who passed away at the age of 12 after contracting tetanus.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Earlier this year, supermodel sisters <a href=#>Gigi and Bella Hadid</a> were the face of the Versace campaign. The fashion house shared various images of the sisters on their official Instagram page to tease the new collection, especially the Medusa bags.</p><p>Versace was first founded in Milan, Italy in 1978 by Gianni Versace. The late designed chose Medusa as the logo for the brand because he was enthralled by the hold the fictional creature had over people and wanted his designs to have a similar effect on the target audience.</p><p>Nowadays, the brand is known for its garish prints and bold colors yet undeniable elegance. According to <a href=#>MD Daily Record</a>, Versace is currently worth approximately $5 billion, and that stands to increase if the new collection is a success.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Jussie Smollett Sentenced To Jail, Must Pay $120,000 For Faking Hate Crime</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>MD Daily Record</a>, <a href=#>W Magazine</a>, <a href=#>Versace</a>, <a href=#>Instagram @iamcardib</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e9WeqayZk5p6tLzRoqWgZaOquq6x0WaamqWglraouoycnKWdkqe2tcWMrKCsrJWnwG6vwKubomWSYrWmus2eqqydqWKxtq2MpaCpmV2ctqi1jJucpaSRYrWisMidZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
