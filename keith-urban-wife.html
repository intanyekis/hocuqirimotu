Nicole Kidman is an Oscar-winning actress and producer who has also won two Emmys and five Golden Globes.</p><p style=text-align:justify>They form one of the most glamorous and powerful couples in the entertainment industry. But how did they meet, and what is their marriage secret?</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>A Chance Encounter at a Hollywood Event</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Keith Urban and Nicole Kidman initially met in January 2005 at G’Day LA, a Hollywood gala celebrating Australians. Kidman, born in Hawaii to Australian parents, had recently divorced Tom Cruise following a ten-year marriage.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Urban had recently ended a relationship with model Niki Taylor, who was born in New Zealand and raised in Australia. They weren’t searching for love, but they connected right away. “I swear to you, she glided across the room, as she floated,” Urban recounted later.</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel=noopener>A post shared by Keith Urban (@keithurban)</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>I’m not sure how she achieved it. It was incredible, and there was a brief moment when she wasn’t with anyone, so I thought, ‘I’ll just go over and say hello.'” Kidman was smitten as well, but she had to wait four months before Urban was contacted.</p><p style=text-align:justify>“Oh, my God, if you ever gave me a man like that, I promise I would be completely devoted for the rest of my life,” she added. Something like that.I requested it and received it.”</p><p><b>For More Details On Other celebrity’s Personal Life Will Be Available, Check Out The Posts Given Below:</b></p><ul><li><a href=# rel=noopener>Kevin Durant Wife: The Personal Side of NBA Star!</a></li><li><a href=# rel=noopener>Kathy Ambush: The Life and Career of Clarence Thomas’s First Wife</a></li></ul><h2 style=text-align:justify>A Whirlwind Romance and a Fairytale Wedding</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Urban and Kidman instantly fell in love and moved in together after their first date. They first appeared together in public at the 2006 Grammy Awards, where Urban won Best Male Country Vocal Performance.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Urban proposed to Kidman in May 2006 with a 3.5-carat diamond ring. They married on June 25, 2006, in front of 230 guests, including Hugh Jackman, Naomi Watts, and Russell Crowe, at the Cardinal Cerretti Memorial Chapel in Sydney, Australia.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Kidman wore a Balenciaga gown and her mother’s veil, while Urban sported a black suit and a rose corsage. The pair exchanged traditional vows and rings, as well as a duet of Rodney Crowell’s “Making Memories of Us,” which Urban recorded. They then celebrated with a reception at Kidman’s friend and business partner,Andrew Kidman’s, neighboring property.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Overcoming Challenges and Growing Stronger Together</h2><p style=text-align:justify>The marriage of Urban and Kidman was not without difficulties. Urban enrolled in a treatment center for the third time in October 2006, barely four months after their wedding, to treat his alcohol problem. Later, he acknowledged using cocaine and ecstasy as well.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Kidman was by his side the entire time he was recovering. “It was a very, very difficult time, and it tested both of us and the union,” she said. But I believe the unity was strong enough, and the love was powerful enough, that we emerged with a deeper understanding of each other.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>Urban also praised Kidman for saving his life and assisting him in discovering his true self. “I was spiritually awakened with her,” he stated. I say, ‘I was born into her,’ and that’s exactly how I feel. And for the first time in my life, I was able to break free from the bonds of addiction.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>The couple also struggled to start a family because Kidman had a miscarriage and an ectopic pregnancy during her marriage to Cruise. She also claimed that she had attempted IVF and surrogacy, but both failed.</p><p style=text-align:justify>They were, however, blessed with two daughters, Sunday Rose, born in 2008, and Faith Margaret, born in 2010 via a gestational carrier. “They are the joy of our lives,” Kidman remarked. I’m quite appreciative. I’ve had two distinct lives. I believe the first half of my life was spent figuring out who I was, and then I was given the incredible opportunity of being able to help create life.”</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Balancing Their Careers and Their Family Life</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Both Urban and Kidman have continued to flourish in their respective industries while also prioritizing their families. They have a rule of never being away for more than two weeks, and they frequently accompany each other to events and initiatives.</p><p style=text-align:justify>They also want to keep their daughters out of the spotlight and provide them with a regular childhood. They have residences in Nashville, Los Angeles, Sydney, and New York, but they prefer to spend the majority of their time on their Tennessee farm, where they enjoy basic pleasures like cooking, gardening, and hiking.</p><p style=text-align:justify>They also share a passion for music and acting, and they frequently collaborate on creative projects. Urban has written many songs about Kidman, including “Parallel Line,” “Gemini,” and “The Fighter.” Kidman has also starred in music videos for Urban, including “Somebody Like You” and “Only You Can Love Me This Way.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>They’ve also co-produced several films and television shows, including The Undoing, Nine Perfect Strangers, and Special Ops: Lioness. “We’re very much in it together,” Kidman remarked. We’re on the same page. We’re quite supportive of one another. We work well together.”</p><p><strong>Read This Also</strong></p><ul><li><a href=# rel=noopener>Keith Urban Net Worth 2022: Early Life Music Career, Guitar House & Properties, And More Details!</a></li></ul><h2 style=text-align:justify>Celebrating Their Love and Their Milestones</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Urban and Kidman have shared many anniversaries and successes, including their 16th wedding anniversary, 50th birthdays, and several accolades and distinctions.

I’ve never known somebody who knows me as well as she does. I wished I was worthy of someone like Nic, but I was a long way from it when we met. We just happened to discover true love there. “I feel like the luckiest person on the planet.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>“He’s my protector,” Kidman said, echoing his emotions. He’s a powerful man. He’s a dominant dude. He’s a highly confident dude. He’s a wonderful person. He’s an extremely gentle dude. He’s an extremely amusing individual.
