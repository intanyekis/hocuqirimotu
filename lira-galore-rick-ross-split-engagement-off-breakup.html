However, it’s not all that surprising that things crashed and burned so quickly — remember, Rick <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>popped the question during a spontaneous trip</a> to the jewelry store in September, when the pair purchased the $350,000 ring, after they’d just been dating for a few months.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>It was just over a week ago that Rick made headlines for posting a very racy Snapchat video of his young love, which showed her wearing nothing but lacy black lingerie as the couple engaged in some hot and heavy bedroom time. Had they taken things just a few steps further, this one may have even passed for a sex tape!</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hollywoocom-20&l=pf4&o=1" alt width=1 height=1 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-7><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, are you surprised Rick called off his engagement so soon?
