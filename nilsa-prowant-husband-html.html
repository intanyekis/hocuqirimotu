The pair's relationship was solidified after Prowant got pregnant with their first child.&nbsp;</p><p>The reality TV star announced the news via Instagram in December 2020. She uploaded a picture of the two with Gazda's hands on her waist and Prowant holding a letterboard that said Baby Gazda would arrive in May 2021.</p><p>A month later, Gazda proposed to Prowant on her 27th birthday, to which the reality TV star said "Yes." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">announced her engagement</a>&nbsp;via Instagram. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>She gushed about marrying her best friend and said she "would say yes over and over and over again."&nbsp;The couple welcomed their baby son,&nbsp;Gray Allen Gazda, on May 20, 2021, after 31 hours of intense labor.</p><p>On November 21, 2021, Prowant got married at&nbsp;Florida's Sheraton Panama City Beach Golf and Spa Resort.
