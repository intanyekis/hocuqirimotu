Toni Storm set to defend her AEW Women’s Championship against Deonna Purrazzo. Sierra chats with WrestleZone and more. Let’s break it down in this week’s edition of Women’s Wrestling Wrap-Up!</p><h2>The Road to WrestleMania 40 Sets Course</h2><p>After winning the 2024 Women’s Royal Rumble match, <a href=#>Bayley</a> earned the opportunity to choose her challenger for WrestleMania 40. Initially, Bayley claimed that she intended to face WWE Women’s World Champion Rhea Ripley at “The Show of Shows.” However, after months of internal fractures, “The Role Model” ultimately opted to confront her now former Damage CTRL stablemate,<a href=#> IYO SKY.</a></p><p>Bayley announced her decision during Friday’s episode of SmackDown, stating that she was long-aware of SKY, Asuka, and Kairi Sane talking behind her back. When Bayley then asked SKY what had caused their dynamic to change, Sane and Asuka attacked her from behind. Seemingly anticipating her stablemates to turn on her, Bayley swiftly fought back with a lead pipe. Once SKY, Sane, and Asuka retreated, Bayley confirmed that she would challenge SKY for the WWE Women’s Championship at WrestleMania 40 in Philadelphia.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p><a href=#>Bayley Thanks Fans Who Have Stuck Around Throughout Her Journey</a></p><h2>Next Stop: Elimination Chamber</h2><p>With IYO SKY vs. Bayley already made official, WWE is now tasked with setting up a WrestleMania match for the WWE Women’s World Championship — a title currently held by <a href=#>Rhea Ripley. </a>Before she looks ahead to WrestleMania, though, Ripley must first conquer “The Irresistible Force” Nia Jax.</p><p>On Monday’s episode of WWE RAW, General Manager Adam Pearce declared that Ripley would defend the WWE Women’s World Championship against Nia Jax at the Elimination Chamber premium live event in Perth, Australia on February 24. This title match is especially significant given that both Ripley and Jax are Australian-born WWE Superstars. As an added layer, this title match also has WrestleMania implications, as the WWE Women’s World Championship is set to be defended on WWE’s biggest stage in April.</p><p>The challenger to that WrestleMania title match will be determined inside a Women’s Elimination Chamber match. Qualifiers for this chamber match began on RAW this week, with<a href=#> Becky Lynch</a> taking on Shayna Baszler. In a similar repeat of their WrestleMania 36 bout, Lynch defeated Baszler with a Manhandle Slam. With this victory, Lynch secured the first spot in the grueling Women’s Elimination Chamber match.</p><p>Next week’s episode of RAW will see Zoey Stark and Liv Morgan battling for the second slot. Coming off her return at the Royal Rumble, Morgan noted (via a backstage promo) that she is looking forward to serving some revenge on Rhea Ripley, who took her out of action for the previous six months. Zoey Stark, on the other hand, is focused on proving that she is not one to be overlooked anymore.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p><a href=#>Becky Lynch Vows Beat Rhea Ripley At WrestleMania And Make Her Daughter Proud</a></p><h2>Deonna Purrazzo vs. Toni Storm Set For AEW Revolution</h2><p>Upon her return to AEW, <a href=#>Deonna Purrazzo </a>made her objective crystal clear — she wanted the AEW Women’s Championship. As such, Purrazzo placed her attention firmly on the current titleholder, <a href=#>Toni Storm</a>, with whom Purrazzo also shares history with.</p><p>Before their reunion in AEW, Purrazzo and Storm were both invited to wrestle at STARDOM in 2017 and18. On one occasion, Purrazzo unsuccessfully challenged Storm for the SWA Undisputed World Women’s Championship. Following their respective stints in STARDOM, Purrazzo and Storm then met again in WWE. Purrazzo again unsuccessfully challenged Storm for a title, this time for the NXT UK Women’s Championship.</p><p>Now in AEW, Purrazzo is on a mission to avenge those losses. She is also eager to awaken the previous version of Toni Storm, not the “delusional sham” she sees today. After weeks of back-and-forth banter, the two will now meet in the ring for a massive title match. At <a href=#>AEW Revolution</a> on March 3, Storm will defend the AEW Women’s Championship against “The Virtuosa.”</p><p>AEW President Tony Khan first confirmed this matchup last week via X (formerly Twitter).</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p><a href=#>Deonna Purrazzo Explains Why It Felt Like The Time To Leave TNA</a></p><h2 id=h-interviews>Interviews</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>AAW Women’s Champion <a href=#>Sierra</a> spoke with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WrestleZone</a>‘s Ella Jay about ranking in the top 100 of PWI’s 2023 Women’s 250 list, wrestling the legendary Aja Kong, pursuing a medical lab tech degree, her personal and professional goals, and more.</p><p>WWE RAW star Ivy Nile chatted with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sean Ross Sapp of Fightful</a> about her call-up to WWE’s main roster, recently challenging Rhea Ripley for the Women’s World Championship, a potential crossover between WWE and UFC, and more.</p><p>Former WWE SmackDown Women’s Champion Liv Morgan appeared on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">SportsKeeda</a> to discuss her advice for wrestling couples in WWE, the new reality show surrounding Bianca Belair and Montez Ford, and more.</p><p>Knockouts Champion Jordynne Grace joined <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Denise Salcedo</a> to talk about her surprise entry in WWE’s 2024 Women’s Royal Rumble match, how she found out about the opportunity, what it was like during rehearsals, her backstage experience, and more.</p><p>Former WWE Women’s Tag Team Champion Chelsea Green talked with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Steve Fall of WrestlingNewsCo</a> about her LGBTQ-themed Royal Rumble gear, seeing Jordynne Grace compete in the Women’s Royal Rumble, her partnership with Piper Niven, and more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaJ6VlsG2vsSsZmpsZGeBen%2BMsKamnZ6oeri%2BxKyrpaGenHq4vsCpZK6oXam1pnnRqJidZaSkeri%2BxKyrpZ2dlruqrYybnKChnqh6pbHOp6WaZaaoerW7zaJkrJ2kYrOwvoyanLBloprDsLjUraCopl2otqa%2B0Zpkoqakmr%2B3tcSw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
