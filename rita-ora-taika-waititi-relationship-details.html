This time <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rita Ora and Taika Waititi</a> have found themselves on a very big stage, as rumors have been flying here and there about the newly found relationship between the pair.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thor&nbsp;director Taika Waititi and Rita Ora caused quite the stir on social media when news of their possible romance went viral. Fans were confused because it was believed that Taika is still married and the new couple's age gap is a 15-year one. As the fun of this newly discovered connection continues to spiral, we break down what we know about Rita Ora and Taika Waititi's relationship so far.</p><h2 id=rita-shares-a-picture><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Rita Shares A Picture</span></h2><p>Word began to spread on April 21st when Rita Ora put a picture online that featured her and Taika&nbsp;Waititi in similar dressing styles while cuddling. Rita then went ahead and captioned the post "Good times, Memories, random things on my phone and the one I love." That's a pretty romantic tag for a photo and is bound to get the attention of fans. Rita went ahead to hashtag it "#Midweekupdate."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single><strong>RELATED:</strong>&nbsp;</span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This Is Why Fans Think Rihanna Doesnâ€™t Get Along With Rita Ora</a></p><h2 id=rita-and-taika-allegedly-kissing><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Rita And Taika Allegedly Kissing</span></h2><p>During one of the Who? weekly podcasts, an unidentified person claimed to have witnessed Rita and Taika lock lips at a restaurant. This claim raises its head <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">just as Rita Ora</a> and Romain Gavras ended their 6-month-old relationship in February. The authenticity of this claim is not guaranteed, however, but as the popular saying goes, "where there is smoke, there is fire." Her ex-boyfriend Romain Gavras was reportedly in Australia for Australia's The Voice and some work.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taika-and-wife-separated><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Taika And Wife Separated</span></h2><p>With rumors constantly making their way around social media, Taika made it known that he and his wife Chelsea Winstanley have decided to end their marriage quietly. Since this statement, Rita Ora and Taika had been seen repeatedly together at various functions during their time in Australia. Specifically, they were seen with Idris Elba and Sabrina, his wife. We don't know about you, but to us, that screams double date all over.</p><h2 id=rita-and-taika-appear-to-have-been-dating-for-some-time-now><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Rita And Taika Appear To Have Been Dating For Some Time Now</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a recent photo, we see Rita Ora along with Christian Bale, Isla Fisher, and a few others having dinner. In an interview with The Sun, an informant alleged that for about a month now, both the singer and movie director had been dating. However, the pair decided to keep things quiet. The source also insisted that their friends knew about the relationship.</p><h2 id=rita-and-taika-spotted-again><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Rita And Taika Spotted Again</span></h2><p>You can only get spotted a couple of times together before people begin to figure out what's going on. Once again Rita Ora and Taika were seen together in Sydney at the world premiere of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rupaul's Drag Race</a>. There is a thing between the two because it is glaring. However, neither Rita Ora nor Taika has made any official statements on the subject.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=out-in-public-as-a-duo><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Out In Public As A Duo</span></h2><p>We have seen pictures, videos, and all sorts of things regarding Rita and Taika but what we have not seen is the pair step out together as a duo publicly. Well, that is until now. The singer and the director were first seen together as a duo Rita's Prospero Tequila Barbecue Celebration on July 4th.</p><p>The pair gladly took pictures together openly as they rocked some ravishing outfits. Rita appeared in a pink and gold dress while Taika appeared in a coordinated mixture of black, white, red and blue. Black being his trousers and the remaining colors his shirt.</p><p><span class=related-single><strong>RELATED:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Think Taika Waititi, Rita Ora And Tessa Thompson Are In A Love Triangle</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rita-and-taika-grabbing-breakfast><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Rita And Taika Grabbing Breakfast</span></h2><p>We all knew Rita Ora was in town filming The Voice Australia, and the Thor director also filmed in Australia. That is a coincidence. But you know what isn't a coincidence? Rita and Taika grabbing breakfast together. The stars were spotted in Sydney having an early breakfast and could be seen laughing together moments before Taika kissed Rita's hand. Friends do not do that, people with love interests do. Their relationship is getting pretty obvious at this point.</p><p><span class=related-single><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This Is Why Jay-Z Will Never Work With Rita Ora Again</a></span></p><h2 id=speculations><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Speculations</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whether we like it or not, Rita and Taika are linked romantically, as all evidence points towards that direction. There is a vibe or chemistry that exists between them that hasn't just seen daylight. Like all things, with time everything will be made known. Rita and Taika however seem to be having a good time together.</p><h2 id=that-steamy-kiss><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>That Steamy Kiss</span></h2><p>Some very interesting pictures of Rita Ora and Taika Waiti went viral, but there was something different with these ones than others of the alleged couple. Taika and Rita were joined by actress Tessa Thompson as they all three cuddled up and enjoyed their time together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In several images shared by The Daily Mail, Rita and Tessa shared a kiss with each other while leaning over Taika. Others showed the ladies getting close while Taika had an arm around each one of them. When asked about the photos, Taika Waiti told People<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he was not upset they got released,</a> "I think in the world of the internet, everything goes away pretty quick," he said. "And also, 'Is it that big a deal?' No, not really. I was doing nothing wrong. It's fine."</p><h2 id=secret-dating><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Secret Dating</span></h2><p>Celebrities have been known to surprise us with secret weddings and engagements. The rumors surrounding Rita and Taika seem to be solid enough for the above to be possible. Who knows? Could that be the case between Rita and Taika? As noted earlier, no official statements have been made in regards to their sudden hangouts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single><strong>NEXT:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Truth About Rita Ora And Dua Lipa's Relationship</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipoqyRYryzrYytmKKjkWLEorXToquiZaKauaLAyKilrKCZpXqlsdOaoKWrXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
