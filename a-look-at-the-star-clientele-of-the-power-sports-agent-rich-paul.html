Coming a long way from his beginnings in Ohio with his childhood friend <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LeBron James</a>. With how Paul has been able help James throughout his 19 year career, this is bound to attract other high profile players to select him as their agent. These are All Star players outside of LeBron James who are currently clients of Rich Paul.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ben-simmons>Ben Simmons</h2><p>Although Ben Simmons has not played a game yet in 2021-22 NBA season, he has his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fair share of accomplishments</a> during his five seasons in the league. This includes winning Rookie of the Year in 2018, and three consecutive All Star Game appearances from 2019 to 2021. Just like LeBron James, Simmons was selected as the number one overall pick in the draft and has been compared to James as well. Rich Paul definitely has done right by Simmons if he was able to receive a five year, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$177 million contract extension</a> after only his second NBA season and the ability to afford <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a mansion worth just under $5 million</a>.</p><h2 id=anthony-davis>Anthony Davis</h2><p>His and LeBron James connection to Rich Paul is potentially one of the reasons why Anthony Davis got traded from the New Orleans to the Los Angeles Lakers to pair up as teammates. After winning the championship in 2019-20, Davis made a long term commitment to the Lakers by signing a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">five year, $190 million contract extension</a>. This contract made him one of only four players to have signed contract over $100 million in Lakers history. In celebration of the NBA's 75th season, Davis was named one of the 75 best players of all time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=draymond-green>Draymond Green</h2><p>Draymond Green didn't let his rivalry with LeBron James and four match ups in the NBA Finals against him affect the agency he decided to sign with. Less than a year after the Golden State Warriors defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2018 NBA Finals, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Green signed with Paul's agency Klutch Sports</a> in March of 2019. Green's contribution to Golden State's three championships since 2015 didn't go unrecognized as he got rewarded with a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$100 million contract extension </a>only five months after signing with Paul's agency.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=darius-garland>Darius Garland</h2><p>Cavaliers guard Darius Garland is having a breakout year in his third NBA season exceeding team expectations so far and looking to make their first playoff appearance since 2018. As a result to the impressive performance halfway into the season, he was selected to this year's All Star Game in Cleveland. A place that Garland has called home during his young NBA career. Assuming he can continue this level of play before his rookie contract expires, he's bound to be added to the long list of wealthy Rich Paul clients' and could use the money to buy a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$32 million mansion like Anthony Davis</a>.</p><p>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Former NBA Player, JJ Redick, Selling Brooklyn Penthouse For $8.5 Million</a></p><h2 id=zach-lavine>Zach Lavine</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before becoming a two time All Star, Zach Lavine was a young Minnesota Timberwolves player with potential and known for his out of this world athleticism. His first major accomplishments in the NBA was winning the slam dunk contest back to back years in 2015 and 2016. He didn't realize his full potential until he got traded to the Chicago Bulls in the 2018 off-season. Lavine is on the last year of his four year, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$78 million million contract </a>and is expected to have a even bigger pay day when he hits free agency. Whether that's with the Chicago Bulls or not is a question that will be answered in the summer.</p><h2 id=dejonte-murray>Dejonte Murray</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dejonte Murray dealt with trials and tribulations by suffering a torn ACL before the start of the 2018-19 season. Regardless of the age, it's a injury that has derailed rising careers and typically prevents a player from seeing time on the court for about a year. Despite Murray's injury, Rich Paul showcased his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">negotiating skills</a> by getting him a four year, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$64 million contract extension.</a> Murray is in a similar position with Paul's client Darius Garland as both of them are young players who became first time All Stars this season and have their sights on larger paying contracts if they keep at their current pace.</p><h2 id=john-wall>John Wall</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>John Wall may not be in the prime of his career anymore, but his All Star performance is how he was able to sign to a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$170 million contract extension </a>with the Washington Wizards in 2017. Wall is the<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> third highest paid player</a> even with his sporadic appearances on the court in recent years and not suiting up for a single game this season. Whether Wall plays another game during the remaining span of his contract or not, he's still going to be reaping the benefits until it expires in 2023.</p><p>Read Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A King-Size Deal: LeBron James Sells A Small Stake In SpringHill Co.
