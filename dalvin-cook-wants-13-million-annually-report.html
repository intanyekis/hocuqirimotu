The 24-year-old is entering the final season of his rookie four-year contract. Cook is currently scheduled to hit free agency in 2020.</p><p>Schefter also added that Cook "wants to match if not surpass" the $13 million that Houston Texans running back David Johnson makes annually. In 2018, the latter signed a three-year, $39 million extension with the Arizona Cardinals, who wound up trading Johnson to Houston as part of the DeAndre Hopkins blockbuster trade.</p><p>Per Schefter, Cook and the Vikings don't have any scheduled discussions at this times, and the NFC North club has been "unwilling to meet his price."</p><p>Unfortunately for Cook, we're in an era where teams have quickly learned to stop investing so much money in running backs. Johnson's $39 million deal quickly became a problem for Arizona, and fans and pundits are still stunned that they managed to find a taker in Houston.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">[Report] Tom Brady Was Interested In Signing With The New Orleans Saints</a></strong></p><p>In the 2018 offseason, 2017 Offensive Player of the Year Todd Gurley landed a four-year, $60 million extension from the Los Angeles Rams. But knee injuries affected him in 2018 and 2019, and he was released this offseason.</p><p>The New York Jets&nbsp;got less than stellar production out of Le'Von Bell in 2019 after&nbsp;handing the former Pittsburgh Steelers Pro Bowler a four-year, $52.5 million contract in free agency.</p><p>That said, Cook is only about to enter his age-25 season, and he's coming off the best season of his career in which he rushed for 1,135 yards and 13 touchdowns. Cook is unquestionably deserving of a lucrative multi-year deal, but the already cap-strapped Vikings don't seem intent on matching his asking price.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">[Photo] Fan Art Depicts Colin Farrell As The Penguin For "The Batman"</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKifp8G0ecSnq56qpJa2r7nEp6tonJGhw6q6jJymqKNdrK6vwNJmaGxlnZ65rbXOp2Sapp6qrq242Gapnqifp8Fw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
