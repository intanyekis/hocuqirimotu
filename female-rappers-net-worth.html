(typically rhyming and sometimes improvised) are spoken rhythmically over a strong background beat.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Here the word can also mean 'a rap song' or 'a set of rap lyrics,' Oxford says."</p><p>Rap is a primary component of hip hop, composed of rhyme, rhythm, tone, and cadence.</p><p>While the industry has always been male-dominated, female rappers are killing it and amassing a fortune through rap, endorsements, tours, and so
