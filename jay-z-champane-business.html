The investment came after the 2006&nbsp;boycott of Cristal champagne. An&nbsp;executive at that brand made disparaging remarks about rap consumers, according to <a href=#>Forbes</a>. The partnership gives LVMH's Moët Hennessy a global distribution agreement with several&nbsp;marquee wines and spirits under its umbrella. Some of the popular and well-known spirits include&nbsp;Dom Perignon, Veuve Clicquot, Krug and Château d'Yquem.</p><p>The partnership was originally discussed in 2019 and has only grown stronger, thanks to the relationship between <a href=#>Jay-Z</a> and&nbsp;Alexandre Arnault, the son of LVMH founder and chairman Bernard Arnault. The world-renowned rapper described the friendship between him and Arnault as "super chill" and "natural."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“[Alexandre] always keeps his word, very punctual. These are some of the qualities I have myself," Jay-Z stated in his interview with the <a href=#>New York Times</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>You Can Now Drink Champagne In France The Same Way That Jay-Z Does</a></span></p><p>Some may think that <a href=#>during a pandemic</a> isn't the best time to invest in champagne, however, LVMH is playing it smart. The French company isn't only buying a drink brand, but they are putting their foot in the door to introduce themselves into markets that are not served by its brand. The partnership between the French company and American businessman opens up a future of possibility and gives hope for the post-pandemic attitude of consumers.</p><p>Champagne sales were on the uptick pre-pandemic, and in 2019, boasted its seventh consecutive year of record sales in the U.S., according to Forbes. A staggering 297 million bottles of Champagne were exported, with 25 million of those heading to the United States. Definitely not a bad time to invest in Champagne.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Brooklyn native is known as a global business mogul and is savvy with his various businesses and investments, such as a stake in Uber worth an estimated $70 million, part-owner of the Brooklyn Nets NBA team, and founder of an entertainment agency, Roc Nation.</p><p>Congratulations to Jay-Z and LVMH's collaboration! We are sure it's going to be a great success.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Why Africa's Richest Woman Lost Her $3.5 Billion & Fell From Grace</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Instagram- @armanddebrignac,</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>Forbes</a>, <a href=#>New York Times</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS3osWMs2ScoJGivaK6xGaZrquZo7K0v44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
