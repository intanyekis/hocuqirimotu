Her birth sign is Gemini and she belongs to the Caucasian ethnic group. Incidentally, Julie Rose Clapton was born in her mother’s hometown.</p><p>Due to her place of birth, Clapton can easily identify as an American citizen but it is important to point out that her ancestral roots spread across various European and North American countries, including Canada, which is the country of origin of her paternal grandfather who hails from Montreal, Quebec, Canada.</p><p>On her mother’s side, Julie has traces of English, Scottish, and Korean-Irish blood running through her veins. Speaking of parents, the 22-year-old is Eric Patrick Clapton’s first child with his second wife, Melia McEnery.</p><p>Eric Clapton does not need much of an introduction. The English-born singer, songwriter, and guitarist earned his status as one of the pioneers of rock music in the country of his birth with songs such as Wonderful Tonight, Tears In Heaven, Layla, I Shot The Sheriff, Cocaine, Change The World, and several others.</p><p>His 18 Grammy Awards are clear indicators of the level of impact his music has made in the lives of many people all over the world. On the other hand, Julie Rose Clapton’s lesser-known parent, her mother, is a trained graphic designer and administrative assistant whose career journey has dovetailed nicely with being a philanthropist and a socialite as a result of her marriage to the legendary musician.</p><h2><strong>Julie Rose Clapton’s Parents Have Been Married For Over 20 Years</strong></h2><p>Julie Rose Clapton’s parents have been a married couple for more than two decades now. They tied the knot on January 1, 2002, at St. Mary Magdalene Church, in Ripley, England, which incidentally is Eric Clapton’s birthplace. There is more to the story of this couple’s married life though, and it will suit the narrative better to start at the very beginning.</p><p>Julie Rose’s parents met at a party that was held in Columbus, Ohio, in 1998. The party was held in his honor at the end of a typically stirring performance in the city.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/article-2671849-01BD8F930000044D-880_634x426.jpg alt="Julie Rose Clapton" width=696 height=468 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>At the time, the celebrity child’s father was 53 years old and at the peak of his powers, while her mother was a fresh-faced, 22-year-old administrative assistant whose graphic design career was still kicking off.</p><p>They could not contain the sparks that flew between them and soon began dating each other discreetly. The over-30-years age gap was a mountain they surmounted with ease and maintained the relationship for a year before going public in 1999.</p><p>After they made the relationship public, they dated for another three years before exchanging marital vows in front of their friends and family members in 2002. Certain unconfirmed reports claim that Eric Clapton’s history of infidelity nearly brought about the end of the marriage but the couple found a way to set aside their differences and work on the marriage.</p><p>Julie Rose Clapton and her siblings are reaping the rewards of that decision today because her parents are still together.</p><h3><strong>Eric Clapton’s Daughter Was A Guest At Her Parents’ Wedding</strong></h3><p>Not that she knew much about what was going on, but a then-6-months-old Julie Clapton was a guest at her parents’ nuptials. The celebrity child had been welcomed into the world by her parents on June 13, 2001, just 6 months before the 2002 new year’s day event that legitimized her parents’ union.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/article-2671849-01BD8F930000044D-880_634x426.jpg><p>She is not, however, the only child of her parents. She has two younger sisters from her parents’ union and 2 older half-siblings even though one of them died just over a decade before she was born. Clapton’s younger sisters, Ella May Clapton, and Sophie Belle Clapton were born a little over two years apart from each other. Ella May was born on January 14, 2003, while Sophie Belle was born on February 1, 2005.</p><p>The celebrity child’s older half-siblings are her father’s children from previous relationships. Julie Rose Clapton’s oldest half-sibling, Ruth Kelly Clapton was born in January 1985 while her older half-brother was born on August 21, 1986.</p><p>Unfortunately for the family, Eric Clapton’s only son, Connor Clapton did not live beyond his 4th birthday as he died on March 20, 1991, after falling to his death from an open window on the 53rd floor of a Manhattan apartment building.</p><h2><strong>&nbsp;The 22-Year-Old Has A Very Good Relationship With Her Father</strong></h2><p>To say that her father was devastated by the events that occurred 10 years before Julie Clapton’s birth would be a massive understatement. His sense and feeling of loss remained for a long time until Julie Rose was born in 2001. The singer saw her as a consolation gift for the child he lost all those years ago and has treated her as such since she was born.</p><p>He always finds new ways to show her how much he loves her and a very clear example of that devotion and love happened during one of his stage performances on the eve of Julie Rose’s 21st birthday when he compelled the crowd to sing along with him as he sang her a birthday song.</p><p>That gesture, along with several others throughout her over 22 years of existence on earth, has left no doubt in the mind of Julie Rose Clapton that her father loves her dearly.</p><h2><strong>Julie Might Have A Career As An Artist</strong></h2><p>At the time of writing this article, the celebrity kid is still a student but details of her formal education background are unknown at the moment. Her Instagram page @julieclapton is littered with hand-drawn portraits that point to her artistic side and a possible future as an artist.</p><p>Only time will tell how far she is willing to go to convert what appears to be a side hobby into an income-earning endeavor. We will just have to wait and see.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZ60qcDLoqWeZpOkunC21KWgnmWipMCmecKlmKmsn6N6psLEq7CtoJmjtG6twaisrWWVp7akecKlmKmsn6PAbrDArp6hrJWnfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
