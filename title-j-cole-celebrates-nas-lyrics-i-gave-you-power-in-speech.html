This nigga’s the greatest,'” <a href=#>J. Cole</a> said when recalling the first time his older cousin played Nas for him in the car. “All the fronting I was doing just came to a cease and I knew that this was something I was so thankful to be aware of.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>The North Carolina native also talked about Nas’ influence, specifically on his musical career.</p><p>“As a rapper, there’s very few greats that I study and I still continue to study and Nas is obviously one of them,” J. Cole said. “I really had his lyrics printed on my wall… I would print these joints out and I would hang them up on my wall and if you’d walk in my room [you’d be like], ‘What is wrong with this kid?’ I’d just be there standing and reading the lyrics. I really wanted to know what it was like to be that good. I was rapping at the time and it was my goal to be that good.”&nbsp;</p><p>Watch part of J.
