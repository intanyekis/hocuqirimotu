Their spectacular Malibu wedding was one of Hollywood's most elegant and, surprisingly enough, secret weddings to date.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here are the details about the wedding, the guests, the expenses, and everything in between.</p><h2 id=the-celebrity-guest-list>The Celebrity Guest List</h2><p>Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston might've been doomed from the start, but their wedding ceremony was an event that everyone in the early 2000s couldn't stop talking about. Party goers were sworn to secrecy, as well as staffers working the event.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to People</a>, Brad and Jennifer made staffers sign an NDA that would make them liable for a penalty of up to $100,000 if they said anything about the wedding. But that didn't stop guests from opening up about the ceremony months after the fact.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources that were there said that it was an extravagant event that didn't feel "too Hollywood." Guests especially felt the love between the couple during their vows, during which Brad promised to "split the difference on the thermostat" and Jennifer promised to make his "favorite banana milkshake."</p><p>Everyone in attendance was happy to celebrate this union with the couple, including A-list celebrities like Edward Norton, Salma Hayek, Cameron Diaz, Kathy Najimy, and David Spade. Of course, Jennifer's Friends cast mates were also in attendance; Courtney Cox Arquette, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry, and Lisa Kudrow.</p><p>The only one who couldn't come was Matt LeBlanc, who had a prior obligation while filming All the Queen's Men in Budapest at the time. Jen's bridesmaids included actress Andréa Bendewald and documentary filmmaker Kristin Hahn-Stringer, while Brad's groomsmen included his father Will Pitt and his brother Doug. Due to disparaging comments made about Jennifer 4 years prior to the event, <a href=#>her mother wasn't invited</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Is Brad Pitt Like As A Dad?</a></span></p><h2 id=venue-and-extravagant-decor>Venue And Extravagant Decor</h2><p>Along with the 200 guests, the event reportedly hosted 50,000 flowers at the Malibu clifftop venue. La Premiere of Beverly Hills decorated the tables with all types of flowers, including roses, wisteria, tulips and floated lotus flowers in a slate fountain built specifically for the occasion. Brad Pitt was quoted saying that he wanted "the Zen garden look".</p><p>Another special touch was the enticing aroma coming from all the brown sugar candles that were imported from Thailand. As guests began taking their seats, a 6-piece band backed by a 40 member gospel choir began performing a rendition of Al Bowlly’s 1930s classic “Love Is the Greatest Thing before Jennifer came out in her glass-beaded, floor-length, silk-and-satin, low-backed gown designed by Milan designer Lawrence Steele.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the reception, Dermot Mulroney and Melissa Etheridge performed an acoustic version of "Whole Lotta Love," originally written by Led Zeppelin.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston Revealed How She Really Dealt With The End Of 'Friends'</a></span></p><h2 id=it-cost-brad-pitt-and-jennifer-aniston-1-million-and-over>It Cost Brad Pitt And Jennifer Aniston $1 Million And Over</h2><p>At the end of the event, the sun began to set, and the sky was reportedly different shades of red and purple. Once it was dark, the guests were treated to a spectacular fireworks display. This went on for about 13 minutes and featured songs by Radiohead, Garbage, and Jeff Buckley. In total, the entire shebang cost the couple upwards of $1 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And although the marriage didn't last, the pair have since reconciled their differences and remain on good terms. <a href=#>There are rumors circulating that the pair have even sparked their old flame and have reunited in secret.</a></p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Angelina Jolie Made A Full Recovery From Bell's Palsy</a></span></p><p>Whether or not those rumors are true, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Aniston has reportedly told Vanity Fair shortly after their breakup that she still loved Brad Pitt.</a></p><p>“I still feel so lucky to have experienced it. I wouldn’t know what I know now if I hadn’t been married to Brad. I love Brad; I really love him. I will love him for the rest of my life. He’s a fantastic man. I don’t regret any of it, and I’m not going to beat myself up about it. We spent seven very intense years together; we taught each other a lot - about healing, and about fun. We helped each other through a lot, and I really value that. It was a beautiful, complicated relationship."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>The Film The Breakup Helped Jennifer Aniston Deal With Her Divorce From Brad Pitt</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIydoJ1lkqeupXnPoqutZZGjsW62xKelop6Vp3qiusisq6imo2K5osLIrJ9mpZGhtqPBjLCcnZyZo7Rur86sq2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
