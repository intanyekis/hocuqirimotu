Keith, 41, attempted to free Anita from the invader after being roused by the commotion, suffering many stab wounds.&nbsp;</p><p>The attacker was forced to run after Anita struck him with a baseball bat.</p><p>Jason Rawley, Anita’s 12-year-old son, was also awakened by the sounds of the attack.&nbsp;</p><p>Along with two of his siblings from the blended family, he had been sleeping in another bedroom. Jason noticed Keith, hurt and heavily bleeding, in the corridor.</p><p>&nbsp;In “Sleeping with Death,” Jason also saw the attacker wearing a disguise but “had murder in his eyes.”</p><p>Anita ran to a neighbor’s house to make the 911 call after Jason attempted, but the phone line was down. Anita, 34, was evacuated to a nearby hospital after suffering severe injuries.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The police Investigation</strong></h2><p>While police investigated the crime site, chaperones were brought to be with Jason and his two siblings. A back sliding door was open, and a phone connection was cut outside. They saw.</p><p>Anita claimed that, despite the seriousness of her wounds, she didn’t recognize the assailant who stabbed and struck her with an axe. Anita added that a two-month-old unsolved event had caused the phone line to be severed.</p><p>Later, one of the critical pieces of information sought, according to former Largo police detective Mike Short, was whether Anita or Keith was the target of the attack at first.</p><p>Anita was a part-time bookkeeper and a stay-at-home mother, the police discovered. Keith worked as an HVAC specialist.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Who was charged of Keith Yunk Murder?</strong></h2><p>Investigators looked into Anita’s ex-husband Luther Basse, a firefighter in Boise City, Idaho, and Keith’s ex-wife Linda, who lived close by. Dave Smith, a former detective with the Boise PD’s Violent Crimes Division, was called by the Largo police for assistance.</p><p>When Smith contacted Basse, his girlfriend Connie informed him that Basse had gone hunting and would return home that evening at 7 o’clock.&nbsp;</p><p>Outside Basse’s house, Detective Smith put a patrol car in position. Sixteen hours after the incident, he returned at precisely 7 p.m. on Sunday.</p><p>Although he claimed to be alone on a hunting trip in Oregon at the time of Keith Yunk’s death, which couldn’t be verified, Luther Basse, an Oregon fireman and the ex-husband of Anita Yunk, was immediately thought to be a suspect.&nbsp;</p><p>However, because there was no evidence linking him to the attack, authorities could not place him under arrest.</p><p>But about three months later, in March 1992, researchers discovered a critical discovery. According to rumors, Luther’s fiancée told the police that he had a cut on his head when he returned from his claimed hunting trip.&nbsp;</p><p>When Luther was eventually called in for more questioning, he finally confessed to the attack and murder after initially denying any involvement.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC3xKKroWWpqrusecyuqZ2domQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
