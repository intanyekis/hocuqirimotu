Everyone loves to see how the other half lives. The giant mansions, elaborate landscaping, and one of a kind decor are things a lot of people want, but few can afford. That's why we all like to indulge in a little celebrity home voyeurism once in awhile. We might never have the inground pools, his and hers custom walk in closets, and state of the art kitchens that celebrities enjoy on a daily basis, but that doesn't mean we can't dream.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While we can look at the extravagant homes of stars like <a href=#>George Clooney</a>, <a href=#>Madonna</a>, and <a href=#>Julie Roberts</a> and think okay, that makes sense, they worked hard for their money, and they deserve everything they have. But it's a little different when a star who's barely 20 has more money, and more beautiful homes than we could ever imagine.</p><p>Young stars are starting to buy their first homes, and they aren't the one bedroom condos that most of us have to save up for years to put a down payment on. They are fully loaded mansions with lots of space, and all the most cutting edge technology built in. Not only can some of Hollywood's youngest stars afford these places, but they can pay cash, no mortgage required. Here are some of the most extravagant homes of Hollywood's young elite.</p><h2 id=10-taylor-swift---17-75-million><strong>10. Taylor Swift - $17.75 million</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At 25, <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> is arguably one of the most successful musicians in the world right now. She's already worth an estimated $200 million, has sold over 40 million albums, and has won seven Grammy Awards. She grew up in Reading, Pennsylvania on an 11-acre Christmas tree farm, and often spent summers at her family's waterfront vacation home in Stone Harbour, New Jersey.</p><p>In 2013, Swift bought this 700 acre ocean front mansion on Watch Hill, Rhode Island for $17.75 million, which she paid for in cash. But one home is never enough. She also owns a house in Beverly Hills, and penthouses in Tribeca and Nashville.</p><p>She's been known to host parties (like her star-studded birthday bash last year), and get togethers with her best girlfriends, and she's not shy about showing off the interiors of her homes on Instagram.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-kylie-jenner---2-7-million><strong>9. Kylie Jenner - $2.7 million</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Kylie Jenner</a>, the youngest of the Kardashian clan, is a mere 17 years old, but she's already bought her own million dollar home in Calabasas, California. Her role on Keeping Up With the Kardashians has made her enough money to purchase this five-bedroom, five-bathroom home a block away from her sisters, <a title="Kourtney Kardashian Net Worth" href=#>Kourtney</a> and <a title="Khloe Kardashian Net Worth" href=#>Khloe</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But according to<a href=#> realtor.com,</a> she most likely had to have her mother, Kris, help out with the legal side of the deal. The house includes a library, a guest-maid quarters, a pool, a home theater, and a three car garage. <a href=#>Kris Jenner</a> told E! News, â€œKylie has her own vision on how she wants her home to look.</p><p>She has a few months now until she moves in to really take her time and get it together, so she will really embrace that time, and get really creative."</p><p></p><h2 id=8-drake---7-7-million><strong>8. Drake - $7.7 million</strong></h2><p>Toronto rapper, <a href=#>Drake</a>, is one of the biggest names in hip-hop now, and he loves to live the hip-hop lifestyle. He has a self-proclaimed obsession with gigantic pools, and one of his goals in life is to own the biggest residential pool on the planet.</p><p>He bought his current mansion in Hidden Hills in 2012 (when he was 25), and promptly named it "YOLO Estate". The property includes an elaborate pool, waterfall and grotto&nbsp;(above).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The house itself boasts a movie theater, a tennis/basketball court, stables, a mechanical bull, a bookshelf that "swings open to reveal his bedroom," and a recording studio. He gave fans a rare peek inside his home via Instagram, showing off his decor, which of course included a basketball net in his bedroom.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-josh-hutcherson---2-5-million><strong>7. Josh Hutcherson - $2.5 million</strong></h2><p>Star of The Hunger Games, <a href=#>Josh Hutcherson</a>, became a homeowner at the age of 19 when he purchased "The Tree House" in the Hollywood Hills in 2012. The house, which was owned previously by <a href=#>Ellen DeGeneres</a>, <a href=#>Will Ferrell</a> and <a href=#>Heath Ledger, </a>was built in the 1950's, and meant to be an ultra-private getaway in the middle of the city. The nickname "the tree house" was given because of its location at the top of the tree line, which is what allows for so much privacy.</p><p>The 2,500 square foot outdoor living space definitely makes the house unique, and features a movie lounge, dining/barbecue space, and multiple seating areas perched in the trees, plus integrated sound, projection and security systems.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The two-bedroom, two-bathroom interior includes high wood ceilings, and an open concept layout that integrates indoor and outdoor living seamlessly.</p><p></p><h2 id=6-jennifer-lawrence---8-2-million><strong>6. Jennifer Lawrence - $8.2 million</strong></h2><p>The real star of The Hunger Games, and Oscar-winner, <a href=#>Jennifer Lawrence</a>, who is 24, recently bought a home in the Hollywood Hills. She joked with Extra! host <a href=#>Mario Lopez</a> about the house's celebrity riddled past. "I just moved into a house. I am in the middle of decorating it. It's <a title="Ellen DeGeneres Net Worth" href=#>Ellen</a>'s old house. It was <a href=#>Jessica Simpson</a>'s old house. It's like the neighborhood wh*re."</p><p>The five-bedroom, five-bathroom, 5,500 square foot house includes amenities such as a koi pond in front, a pool in the backyard and a spiral staircase in the foyer.</p><p>The neighborhood is full of other A-listers, including <a href=#>Mila Kunis</a> and <a href=#>Ashton Kutcher</a>, and <a href=#>Nicole Kidman</a> and <a href=#>Keith Urban</a>.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-miley-cyrus---3-9-million><strong>5. Miley Cyrus - $3.9 million</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2011, at the age of 19, <a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a> purchased her first house in Studio City for just shy of $4 million. The midcentury-modern home is over 5,000 square feet , and includes five bedrooms and six-and-a-half baths.</p><p>At the center of the H-shaped floor plan â€” ideal for unobstructed views of the property â€” sits an expansive living room with floor-to-ceiling windows that open up to her backyard.</p><p>The backyard is perfect for entertaining and has been the setting of numerous parties. It includes a cabana with a Hollywood sign, a large hammock, and an in ground pool.</p><p></p><h2 id=4-iggy-azalea---3-45-million><strong>4. Iggy Azalea - $3.45 million</strong></h2><p>2014 was a big year for rapper, I<a href=#>ggy Azalea</a>. She was nominated for four Grammys, and her debut album, The New Classic, topped the charts.&nbsp;To top things off, the 24-year-old just purchased a house in Tarzana, California, previously owned by<a href=#> Selena Gomez</a>, with her L.A Lakers boyfriend, Nick Young.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The 6,600 square foot, six-bedroom, seven-bathroom includes a single-story main house and, above the attached two-car garage, a fully self-contained, one-bedroom guesthouse with private entrance, and a wrap around balcony.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-emma-roberts---1-4-million><strong>3. Emma Roberts - $1.4 million</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Emma Roberts </a>is steadily making a name for herself in shows like American Horror Story and the upcoming Scream Queens. She purchased a house in the Hollywood Hills in 2012 when she was only 20 years old. The three-bedroom home has a private gym, media room, and spacious, secluded garden.</p><p>Roberts told <a href=#>Jay Leno</a> in an interview, "it's a huge responsibility. I didn't realize how much work goes into having a house.</p><p>I thought when I got my house I would have friends over all the time, but I'm so crazy about anything getting scratched or spilled, I've turned into a 40-year-old woman stopping people and asking them to use a coaster."</p><p></p><h2 id=2-robert-pattinson---1-6-million><strong>2. Robert Pattinson - $1.6 million</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Famous for his role as a glittery vampire, <a href=#>Robert Pattinson</a> made enough money at a young ago to afford a mansion in the Hollywood Hills. He has a net worth close to $100 million, but he isn't the extravagant type. The two-bedroom, two-bathroom, less than 2000 square foot house he purchased at the end of 2014 is more than enough for him. The one splurge it does include is a $14,000 custom made cast iron range from the UK.</p><p>The property includes a long, red brick lane ways, a kidney-shaped pool, and lots of shrubbery and landscaping designed specifically to provide more privacy.</p><p>The house is significantly more modest that the $6.2 million Los Feliz home Pattinson bought in 2011 and sold in 2014 to Big Bang Theory's <a href=#>Jim Parsons</a>.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-lady-gaga---24-million><strong>1. Lady Gaga - $24 million</strong></h2><p>The home of <a href=#>Lady Gaga</a> can't be anything but eccentric, top of the line, and extravagant.

The house sits on 6 acres of land, and features his and her walk-in closets, a pool, gym, and wine cellar. It also has a custom safe room and 2 lane bowling alley, bocce ball court and an 8-horse stable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The house also includes a chef's kitchen with all modern appliances, making it perfect for hosting lavish parties. There is also a guest cottage, caretaker's apartment, motor court and three car garage.</p><p>Despite owning the lavish compound, Gaga and her fiancee, <a href=#>Taylor Kinney</a> often spend time in his $400,000 three-bedroom house in Pennsylvania, close to his home town.</p><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=#>people.com</a>,&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=#>tmz.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>elledecor.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>realtytoday.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>glamourmagazine.co.uk</a>, &nbsp;<a href=#>zillow.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZqaF2ivLTAjKKlrJmemnqurc2soKimo2K8p3nHqKOlsaekvKW%2FjLKmrqaXYsC1rdGsZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
