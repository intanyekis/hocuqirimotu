In court documents, Angelina accused Brad of having alcohol issues and being abusive, including during a 2016 incident on a private jet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The jet incident was apparently the catalyst for their break-up. Angelina claims Brad became physical with some of their children when they tried to intervene in the fight. The FBI later launched an investigation but cleared Brad. Since then, Brad has been trying to maintain access to their minor children, whereas Angelina has reportedly been trying to keep their contact with him limited.</p><p>The report by NewsNation Now claims that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brad has spent over $14 million on their divorce</a> over the years, and he’ll likely have to keep spending big bucks if Angelina doesn’t drop her goal of maintaining primary custody.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Is Angelina Jolie Considering Adopting Again Now That Her Kids Are Almost All Grown-Up?</a></span></p><p>Aside from their custody dispute, Angelina and Brad are engaged in another lawsuit over Chateau Miravel, the French winery they once owned together.</p><p>Brad launched the case after Angelina sold her shares to a Russian oligarch, Yuri Shefler, which Brad claims she did unlawfully and without his knowledge.

It’s apparently taken a toll on their kids, too. In June, it was reported that Brangelina’s children were becoming vocal about their hope for their parents to drop the custody dispute.</p><p>"Angelina doesn't want to let her fight for sole custody go, but the children are growing up, and even they tell their mom it's time to stop," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source told Radar Online</a> in June.
