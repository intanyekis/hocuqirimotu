And indeed, the 1985 classic “The Goonies” became a runaway hit upon its release nearly four decades ago. Following a group of loyal friends as they embark upon a daring search for a treasure stolen by the infamous 17th-century buccaneer One-Eyed Willy in the hopes of saving their neighborhood from greedy developers, the family adventure story broke records as one of the top-10-grossing films of the year. And in the three-plus decades since, its fame has only grown, cementing the flick’s status as a veritable cult favorite with anniversary celebrations regularly held in Astoria, the small coastal town in Oregon that served as its central setting. As The Columbian noted in a 2010 article detailing one such soiree, “This is devotion in its purest form, built on a 114-minute movie filmed here and released in June 1985. Since then, there’s been almost nothing to fan the flames of fandom – no resuscitated spinoffs, à la ‘Star Wars’ or ‘Star Trek.’ Years ago, there was a board game and a Nintendo game. There are always talks of a sequel that will likely never materialize. Still, the fans come to celebrate their love of ‘The Goonies.'”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED:</b><a href=#><b>Ellen DeGeneres And Portia De Rossi Purchased The Iconic Brown-Sidney House For $29 Million</b></a></span></p><p>At the top of participants’ to-do list is invariably a pilgrimage to the movie’s prominent locations, most notably the rambling Victorian that portrayed the onscreen home of the Walsh family, where siblings Mikey (Sean Astin) and Brand (Josh Brolin) live with their parents, Mrs. Walsh (Mary Ellen Trainor) and Mr. Walsh (Keith Walker). Known amongst fans as “‘The Goonies’ House,” in real life the three-story structure stands nestled atop a picturesque bluff overlooking the Columbia River at 368 38th St. (Please remember this is a private home. Do not trespass or bother the residents or the property in any way.), according to <a href=#><i>Dirt</i>.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Easily one of the most famous houses in moviedom, the place sent shockwaves across the internet last month when it was put up for sale for the first time in over two decades. Listed with Jordan Miller of John L. Scott Real Estate at a swashbuckling $1.65 million, prospective buyers didn’t have long to liquidate their marble bags to finance a purchase as it was scooped up by one lucky individual a mere six days after hitting the market! Miller told The Oregonian, “After the word spread that the property was for sale, we received multiple offers, at asking price and higher, and we have a full backup offer.” Not surprisingly, the purchaser is a “Goonies” fan who, according to the paper, is most excited to “live in the Goon Docks” and even plans on rebuilding the unique mechanism that opened the Walsh family’s front gate in the film!</p><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT:</b><a href=#><b>MDLBeast Soundstorm 2022: Biggest Comeback Of All Time, Five Rap Legends Light Up The Big Beast Stage With DJ Khaled</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Dirt</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmasoJmrsrN5zJ5kraGdl7Kzv4ytn55ll6S8r7XErGShp6Wosm6%2BxKmmq6yVmbm6edKaoKWrXaSzp3nToZxmpZGnuKbAjKKlZqeeocZuv8ixZJ2Zqah6p7vRZmhmbmViuqq4y6Kmp2c%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
