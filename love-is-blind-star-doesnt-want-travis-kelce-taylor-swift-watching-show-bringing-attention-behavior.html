Taylor Swift, if you're watching it with him, please stop."

Don't worry. She's a girl," one fan wrote. "Ewww, is there a video of Travis Kelce making this impression?" another commented. "That was so mean of him," a fan commented. Some even went so far as to refer to Kelce mocking Blackwell as "bullying."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"This breaks my heart and disappoints me greatly. We have been huge supporters of TK, and we LOVE TS. But we are not down for bullying in any way, shape, or form," one comment reads. "YOU ARE AMAZING, CHELSEA don't let ANYONE, no matter WHO they are or WHO they think they are. Confident people don't bully others." Another fan had a similar outlook, writing, "Travis has his own issues if he thinks mocking people is OK. On the bright side, @taylorswift makes ppl rich with a simple act of support, so I say get your wallet ready and welcome all the good coming to you!"</p><p><strong>There was also a comment from the official New Heights Instagram page, so Travis or Jason Kelce had likely seen her response.</strong> "Imitation is the highest form of flattery … (we've all been there)," the comment reads. Fans reacted to this comment, telling the brothers they needed to invite Blackwell to their show and that they were "the best."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-did-travis-kelce-say-about-chelsea-blackwell>What Did Travis Kelce Say About Chelsea Blackwell?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/travis-kelce-3.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kelce made his fans laugh when he impersonated Blackwell</a> on an episode of the New Heights podcast, which he hosts alongside his brother, Jason Kelce. <strong>One scene from Season 6 of the dating show stood out for him</strong>.

"'You think I'm clingy? I'm clingy? Really?'" But Blackwell can rest easy for now because <a href=#>Kelce and Swift are both on vacation</a>, and he is unlikely to playfully mock her again anytime soon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijqK6VYra0ecGloKecXajBor6Mnaaeq56peritza1kraqRq7a0ecqeo5ydXamuurjOq2Ssr5mbwW7DwK2aoaGenHq0tM6wZJuqmaO0qrrGZpitrJWjwaq7zWaZnqCRq7awvo4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
