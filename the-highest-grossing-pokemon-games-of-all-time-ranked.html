The game has improved graphics from the <a href=#>previously released games</a> and can also print Pokédex entries.

While it was criticized for lacking the Pokémon Platinum content, a lot of Pokémon fans are glad that the remakes were rolled out and actually turned out well. New areas were introduced such as Ramana's Park, <a href=#>ensuring that the game</a> doesn’t miss out on the legendary and mythical feel of Pokémon. The Grand Underground also made it easy to catch pre-Gen 4 Pokémon vibes even though players have to unlock the National Dex to get that. This game sold 14.79 million copies as of June 2022 but seeing as it was released in 2021, there’s a great probability that it will sell more copies.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The 10 Best-Selling Video Games Of All Time</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=pok-mon-black-amp-white-15-64-million>Pokémon Black & White (15.64 Million)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Pokémon-Black-White.jpg> Via Flickr/Clay Watts<p>Pokémon Black and White were published in 2010 for Nintendo DS.
