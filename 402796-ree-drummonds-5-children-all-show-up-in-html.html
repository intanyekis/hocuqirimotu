The menu was cut down to biscuits and gravy, but the paper plates really put a smile on the TV host's face.</p><p class=Xg>As much as they all missed Easter-loving <a class="ie l" href=#>Chuck and Nan</a>, Ree Drummond was grateful to have their "big, wacky crew" together. In pastel pink bunny ears, eldest Alex Drummond Scott was seen helping <a class="ie l" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/Cq1Jk4uuamz/>her mom</a> and sister Paige Drummond with the gravy in a post from Easter Sunday.</p><p class=Xg>The entire Drummond tribe, including Paige's boyfriend<strong class=Vg>,</strong> Mitchell Adams, and Alex's husband, Mauricio Scott, posed for a <a class="ie l" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/food/pioneer-woman-ree-drummond-5-kids-reunite-for-casual-easter-dinner/>priceless group photo</a> on the stoop. In the following picture, Betsy Smith, Ree's little sister, smiled with the Drummond ladies.</p><p class=Xg>Mauricio also donned <a class="ie l" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/Cq3fTpDOagK/>bunny ears</a> for his Easter activity, arm wrestling with Ree and Ladd Drummond's foster son Jamar Goff. "All we ever do as a family is a fight, wrestle, compete, and eat," the "Pioneer Woman" host <a class="ie l" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/Cq3fTpDOagK/>captioned</a> the update on Monday, punctuated with a laughing-crying emoji.</p><h3 class=bh><strong class=Vg>The Food Network star gently prepared for her empty nest.</strong></h3><p class=Xg>Last Easter, her <a class="ie l" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://hollywoodlife.com/feature/ree-drummond-kids-5065068/ ">third child</a> and eldest son, Byrce Drummond, saved the holiday by taking the 30 lb turkey from the oven, a far cry from the simplified spread of this year.</p><p><h2 class=ah><strong class=Vg>Ree Drummond Kept Zooming in on Todd's Eyelashes</strong></h2></p><p class=Xg>While Alex and Paige were <a class="ie l" href=#>home-schooled</a> before heading to college and pledging at sororities, their two brothers experienced some <a class="ie l" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://hollywoodlife.com/feature/ree-drummond-kids-5065068/ ">high school</a> where they excelled in football. Ree mentioned their <a class="ie l" href=#>foster child</a> Jamar for the first time in her 2020 book "Frontier Follies."</p><p class=Xg>Due to social media restrictions by the state agency, she could not mention him on social media or elsewhere until he was 18. As an "inextricable part" of the family, she was happy to now write about Jamar, and he also appreciated being included.</p><p class=Xg>The Food Network star gently prepared for her <a class="ie l" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/Cljkx57ua8K/>empty nest</a> in the lead-up to her youngest, Todd Drummond's departure to college in South Dakota. She explained that she and <a class="ie l" href=#>Ladd Drummond</a> are setting new routines like hiking, which even her husband could justify because they picked up trash along the way.</p><p class=Xg>The first week of January, <a class="ie l" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CnDgpPgOuAv/>the couple</a> packed Todd's life in <a class="ie l" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CnKzcDHub3T/>their car</a> and left the ranch for South Dakota.
