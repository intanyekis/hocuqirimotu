Several NFL coaches have spoken out throughout the years about losing weight by eating a healthier diet.</p><p>Rex Ryan and Jay Gruden, two former NFL coaches, have talked about their weight loss adventures. Patricia is under criticism following the Eagles’ catastrophic season-ending loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. A few reviewers called Patricia’s promotion as a play-caller a particularly nasty deed. So, will Patricia stay in Philadelphia for the following season? Most Eagles supporters will say, “Hopefully not!”</p><h2>Matt Patricia Weight Loss: Has the Eagles Coach Cut Back on Calories?</h2><p>In 2020, many NFL fans debated NFL coach Matt Patricia’s weight gain over the summer. Patricia was the head coach of the Detroit Lions when this occurred. The NFL coach’s weight gain could be attributed to his Achilles issue.</p><p>Matt’s injuries prevented him from putting weight on his leg or moving without artificial aid. The former Detroit Lions head coach was riding about on an ATV and even used a golf cart for a while. When asked about his health, Patricia replied, “We’re still taking it day by day, but we’re seeing some progress.</p><p><strong>I think I’ve had around four different casts on. “This is a walking boot, but I’m still in the same mode right now.”</strong></p><p>Matt Patricia Photo Matt’s weight has gradually increased over time. On X (formerly Twitter), NFL fans insulted the coach’s weight. One person said,</p><p><strong>“My whole family is making fun of Matt Patricia’s weight…. wouldn’t you stress eat if you were the head coach of the Lions???”</strong></p><p>However, based on recent press reports, it appears like the Eagles coach may have shed some unwanted body fat. The senior defensive assistant may have finally chosen to pursue a healthier lifestyle.

Sanders characterized his routine as waking up at 5 a.m. to go to the gym, followed by a handful of almonds</p><p>He next eats a banana-strawberry smoothie and grits for breakfast, which fuels him for his morning practice. Coach Prime said he tries to eat enough protein and vegetables while avoiding fried meals and sugar. Rex Ryan, the former New York Jets and Buffalo Bills coach, formerly weighed more than 350 pounds.</p><p>He lost more than 100 pounds after lap-band surgery, but regained the majority of them when the band was removed in 2016. However, in 2018, the former NFL coach said that he had lost weight to compete on The Amazing Race. Ryan lost 50 pounds in a month and a half by consuming more protein and vegetables and decreasing his snacking.</p><p>Rex also stated that he lowered his use of soda and began exercising more often. The Super Bowl-winning coach also revealed that he only ate Mexican cuisine once a week, which he appreciated. Jay Gruden, the former Washington Commanders coach, also discussed his weight loss journey, admitting that he had ballooned to over 250 pounds before losing 30 pounds in the summer of 2018.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Is Deadliest Catch&#39;s Josh Harris Wed?
