As she does her makeup in their bedroom, her blonde hair can be seen from afar.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Micah-Plath-Gives-Fans-a-Glimpse-at-New-Girlfriend-in-Welcome-to-Plathville-Season-6-First-Look.jpg><p>“Make sure you clean up the hair in the sink,” the mystery girl says. “And the counter!”</p><p>The blonde then comes into the bathroom to check on Micah’s progress cleaning the sink. Her side profile is visible for a quick moment, as she says, it’s not “really clean.” The girl is wearing a pink and green floral dress and has a silver chain bracelet on her wrist.</p><p>“This is the first time I’ve moved in with someone before,” Micah tells the cameras after his girlfriend has left the room. “The little things matter more than the big things.”</p><p>He confesses that living in his partner’s Florida home has led to a few issues.</p><p>“Don’t get me wrong, I love being able to help my girlfriend around her house … but it can be a lot,” Micah explains as scenes of the reality star gardening, cleaning, doing the dishes and checking off his to-do list flash across the screen.</p><p>At one point, the model takes his shirt off while digging a trench outside and refuses to put it back on. “I will not answer one more question with my shirt on!” Micah teases while sitting down for his confessional.</p><p>Micah’s love life isn’t the only big change for season 6 of the show.
