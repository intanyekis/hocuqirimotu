You can never be too prepared for vacation! When she arrives,<strong> Brian</strong> offers her some rum and she refuses. She drank it once and totally “regretted” it. “I genuinely just don’t want to make an irresponsible decision, you know?” Monica explains in her confessional while sitting next to her dad.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>The producer asks Monica if that’s because Brian will be on the trip. Monica stutters a bit and her dad asks, “Is it?” The producer asks Monica if she’s told her dad about what happened. Monica rejected Brian in the last episode because of his playboy ways. Monica says she hasn’t told her dad anything about what happened with Brian. “We need to have a conversation, I guess,” her dad muses.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4><strong>Shaan’s</strong> cousin, <strong>Nehali</strong>, also shows up for the trip. The party bus soon arrives.<strong> Bali</strong> shows up at the last minute. While a Key West trip would seem like a fun getaway, Anisha is not really looking forward to the trip at all. “This Key West trip is my worst nightmare,” she says. She admits she is terrified of germs. Getting on a party bus doesn’t really help with that.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“Plus, I’m mad at half the people on this trip and I’m going to be on a bus with them. I think the bus is karma,” Anisha continues. She might be spot-on about that. Family Karma airs Sundays at 9 p.m. Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH11e49sZp%2BZnZ65unnKmqmmmV2ivK%2B1wppkm6qZlrtuwM6gnK2glad6tb7IqWSeqJmovKWxjG5kqaqVq7amw4yvoJ2dn2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
