Sure, she’s championed emerging designers and staged impromptu outfit photo shoots back home in the US, but her working holiday has underlying motives. Her aim is to fully ingratiate herself with the fashion crowd, achieved via a head-turning wardrobe.</p><p>Kylie Jenner accessorized the bold look with a small red purse and nude heels.</p><p>She has already served four stunning looks during Paris Fashion Week, which ends on Oct. 04.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For Acne Studios' presentation on Wednesday, the Kylie Cosmetics founder wore an angelic white dress with long sleeves and a floor-skimming hemline, which she paired with huge studded hoops and oversize white sunglasses.</p><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED: </b><a href=#><b>‘Mother & Daughter Duo’ Kylie Jenner And Kris Jenner On Their Luxurious Matching Outfits</b></a></span></p><p>Kylie Jenner’s sister Kendall has become a well-seasoned catwalk model, but Kylie’s intentions feel more closely aligned with Kim’s role in the industry. Like the Skims mogul, she’s placed herself front and center on the FROW at shows, commanding attention in new-season looks fresh off the runway. One such look came courtesy of Dilara Fındıkoğlu, who showed her spring/summer 2023 collection at London Fashion Week. For another Paris outing, Kylie wore a lingerie-inspired naked dress, which had hook-and-eye closures snaking up the body and red fabric details. The dress from Acne Studios’s spring/summer 2023 collection that she wore on the second day of Paris Fashion Week.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2><img width=640 height=801 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/fbOob_WPJUFGahcZiIcqOQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTY0MDtoPTgwMQ--/s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/arxM04YX5FtmiuYgxWHaWA--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MTU5OTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/2d70070bdf90ce410b642fc6a393f63b alt="Kylie Jenner Gets Futuristic in France, Plus Brooklyn Beckham, Lily Allen, Tyra Banks and More" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h2><p>The Kylie Cosmetics founder kicked things off in the city of light on Wednesday, heading to the Acne Studio spring/summer 2023 show in a drapey gown with batwing sleeves by the designer.
