Eventually, John is diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).</p><p>It’s a journey that closely mirrored the one shared by Schumer and Fischer in real life, when Fischer was diagnosed with ASD shortly after the couple’s 2018 wedding.</p><p>“I knew from the beginning that my husband’s brain was a little different than mine,” Schumer said in her 2019 Netflix special <i>Growing</i>. “Once he was diagnosed, it dawned on me how funny it was, because all of the characteristics that make it clear that he’s on the spectrum are all of the reasons that I fell madly in love with him.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Amy-Schumer-Details-%E2%80%98Supportive-Collaboration-With-Husband-Chris-Fischer-on-%E2%80%98Life-Beth-2.jpg><p>While <i>Life & Beth</i> is loosely based on Schumer’s <a href=#>actual life and experiences</a>, she never wants to get<i> too</i> into the nitty gritty.</p><p>“I really try to pick and choose,” she <a href=# rel=noopener>told<i> The Hollywood Reporter</i></a> in February. “With my own personal life, there are some things, like the birth scene, that’s pretty much [how it happened]. There are some elements that are obviously exaggerated, but some of it is direct from my life and conversations that I’ve had, and other stuff is a collaboration from the writers and the actors. It really is an amalgamation of everybody’s lives.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>When it came to writing about the autism diagnosis, Schumer told <i>THR</i> that the writers’ room hired a clinical psychologist to make sure they were getting things right.</p><p>“We really wanted to be respectful and show that, when we talk about the spectrum, what that word means,” she said. “It’s a wide spectrum, and this is part of it that you don’t often get to see: a super high-functioning person. And that that’s not what defines him.”</p><p>Both seasons of <i>Life & Beth </i>are available to stream on Hulu.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJimsV2osKnBzJ6pZpyVqa6quNJmqq6ooKS%2FtbXVnmScp5yhrqN51qKroWWYqsCjrc2dZJygop7AbrLIrJqhnaJk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
