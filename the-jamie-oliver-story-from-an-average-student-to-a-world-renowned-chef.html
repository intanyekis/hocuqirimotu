Before Jamie Oliver became a renowned worldwide Chef, he was just a simple kid living in Clavering, Essex. Jamie Oliver was born and raised in a village located in Clavering in Essex. His parents Trevor and Sally ran a restaurant called The Cricketers, where he, later on, practiced cooking. During his childhood years, <a href=#>he used to cook in the restaurant’s kitchen</a> together with his parents. He has one sibling named Anne-Marie, and both of them were schooled at the Newport Free Grammar School.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While some of the kids already know precisely what they want to do in life, Oliver took some courses before finally finding his passion for cooking. At the early age of sixteen, he left his school to get GCSE qualifications in Art and Geology and eventually attend Westminster Kingsway College. After some time, he earned City & Guilds National Vocational Qualification in Home Economics.</p><p>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Jamie Oliver Net Worth</a></p><h2 id=overcoming-his-disability>Overcoming His Disability</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jamie Oliver used to be placed in a special needs classroom because of his dyslexia, but that does not stop him from being one of the best chefs worldwide. For five years of his grade school life, he has struggled in his classes because of his dyslexia. Oliver admitted that he could not <a href=#>blossom in his studies </a>in one of his interviews, and his dyslexia affected his school performance big time. Unfortunately, he does not think that their school recognized his struggles with suffering from dyslexia. As a result, he was not given the proper supplementary materials and ample support to help him in his studies. As a result, during that time, he was miserable and could not excel in school. Looking back, Oliver hopes for everyone in the education field to have a much better understanding of dyslexia. However, he thinks that the current academic system is much better as they are better suited to catering to struggling students with learning disabilities.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Academically, Oliver was not given a place to shine, but he knows that he worked well using his hands. He did not let his academic struggles hinder his drive to succeed in life. He soon started <a href=#>working in restaurants at a very young age,</a> and he excelled at it. He believes that having dyslexia is never an excuse for one to prosper and succeed in life. His school performance might be poor, but his work experiences in the kitchen quickly improved. He found passion in his work in restaurants which became his driving force to become one of the greatest chefs in the world.</p><h2 id=the-discovery-of-his-talent-for-cooking>The Discovery Of His Talent for Cooking</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The parents of Oliver were the owners of a pub restaurant in Clavering, Essex. He persistently begged the chefs of their restaurants to let him assist them. Finally, after his persistent plea, he was allowed to work in the kitchen. When Oliver turned 16, he entered Westminster Catering College; he traveled to France to have additional training and experience. He then landed his first job at the Neal Street Restaurant in London as a head pastry chef. After his career at Neal Street Restaurant, he worked as a sous chef at River Café, where his talent was honed.</p><p>While working at the café, his talent was discovered in front of the camera while filming a documentary that took place in the restaurant. Soon after his discovery, he was offered a contract to host his first series, <a href=#>The Naked Chef by Optomen Television</a>. He demonstrated how someone could easily prepare food recipes just by using essential ingredients and techniques.</p><h2 id=jamie-oliver-s-career-started-to-blossom>Jamie Oliver's Career Started To Blossom</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Soon after the first show he hosted, he starred in numerous cooking TV programs, including Oliver’s Twist in 2002 and s<a href=#>everal more Naked Chef series.</a> During this time, Oliver decided to write a book which later on became one of the best-selling cookbooks, and he soon then launched his cookware line. He also gives back to the community; in 2002, he founded the Fifteen Foundation, a London-based program that allows underprivileged youths to experience a career in the culinary industry.</p><p>With his passion for cooking and irresistible charm, he soon became the second richest chef globally with a net worth of $400 million, following Alan Wong with $1.1 billion. His cooking style was loved by many because he makes each recipe simple and easy to follow. He has a <a href=#>chain of restaurants called Jamie’s Italian</a>. Many of his cookbooks have become No. 1 UK bestsellers, and he was even awarded Member of the Order of the British Empire in 2003. His book 30 Minute Meals became the fastest-selling nonfiction book of all time following its publication in 2010.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Green Spice: How Alan Wong Became The Richest Celebrity Chef In The World</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Guardian,</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dyslexia Help</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Britannica</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hello Magazine</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wealthy Gorilla</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbGMo5imoZVivK211Z6pZqukpL%2B6ecWrpqZlkaN6osLEq5ignV2owbawxKerZqyfYq5uw86ro51lopq7sMPNnptmm5ias3A%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
