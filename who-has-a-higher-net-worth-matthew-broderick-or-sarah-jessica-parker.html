In fact, some celebrity marriages came to an end <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in a flash</a>. Of course, if a marriage isn’t meant to last, it probably is a good thing for everyone involved that it comes to an end quickly. Still, it is strange that it often seems like there is something about being a star that isn’t conducive to having a lasting marriage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unlike a lot of their peers, Matthew Broderick and Sarah Jessica Parker have managed to stay together for many, many years at this point. During their time together, Parker and Broderick have been at one another’s side as they both built their careers. With that in mind, it is interesting to see whether it is Broderick or Parker who has managed to accumulate more wealth over the years.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Of The Shortest Celebrity Marriages Ever</a></span></p><h2 id=the-happy-couple>The Happy Couple</h2><p>Back in 1991, Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick were introduced through mutual friends. A couple of months later Broderick asked Parker out on a date for the first time and from all available information, the couple has been together ever since.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Believed to be very happy together from the start, Sarah Jessica Parker once revealed that she never worried about what dress she would wear if she and Matthew Broderick got married. Instead, she remembers <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">thinking to herself</a>, “God, I really hope he asks me to marry him”. Thankfully, Broderick eventually popped the big question and the couple tied the knot after inviting 140 guests to a surprise wedding they originally claimed was a simple party.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Five years after Matthew Broderick and Sarah Jessica Parker got married, their son entered the world in 2002, and then their twin daughters were born almost seven years later. Unlike some couples who’ve struggled to remain passionate about one another after staying together for many years and having kids, that doesn’t seem to be a problem for Broderick and Parker. Instead, Parker once blurted out <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how much she adores her husband</a> during a Harper’s Bazaar interview. “I love Matthew Broderick”. “I love our life… It's because of him that there's this whole other world that I love."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sarah Jessica Parker And Matthew Broderick: What We Know About Their Private Life</a></span></p><h2 id=matthew-rsquo-s-money>Matthew’s Money</h2><p>From the moment that Matthew Broderick became a star, he has come across as an incredibly lovable guy even though he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">almost wound up in prison</a> at one point. First introduced to moviegoers as the star of WarGames, Matthew Broderick would go on to land the role of a lifetime when he was hired to star in Ferris Bueller's Day Off. While that movie remains Broderick’s most beloved film to date, he has headlined a slew of other projects that have been embraced by the masses. For example, Broderick’s work in movies like Glory, The Lion King, and The Cable Guy will go down in cinematic history.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of Matthew Broderick’s film career, he has made lots of money in other mediums. For example, Broderick has popped up in shows like Frasier, 30 Rock, Modern Family, and The Conners. More importantly, Broderick is one of the most respected Broadway actors in history since he has been a consistent presence on stage for decades at this point. Due to the money that Matthew Broderick has made from all of those projects, he is worth <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$200 million</a> according to celebritynetworth.com.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sarah Jessica Parker And Matthew Broderick Reunite On Broadway ...

Since Sarah Jessica Parker had a small role in that beloved film, moviegoers all over the world became aware of her acting charms. While that was a great thing for her career, it did have a bit of a negative impact on Parker because she was typecast as a supporting actor for a long time.</p><p>In the years that followed the release of Footloose, Sarah Jessica Parker mostly played supporting roles in big movies or major roles in small projects. For example, Parker portrayed memorable supporting characters in movies like Hocus Pocus, Ed Wood, Mars Attacks!, and The First Wives Club. Due to the fame Parker earned in those roles and her obvious acting talent, she went on to land the lead role in a series that would change her life forever.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From 1998 until 2004, Sarah Jessica Parker starred in one of the most talked-about shows on television, Sex and the City. Unfortunately for Parker, it seems safe to assume that she wasn’t paid that much money for Sex and the City’s first season since nobody knew how popular the show would be. However, once the show became a sensation, Parker was able to negotiate a new deal and according to rumors, she might have been paid as much as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$3 million per episode</a>. While there is no way to know how accurate those rumors are, Parker clearly made a fortune during the final seasons of Sex and the City and when she starred in its spin-off movies. As a result, Parker is worth <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$150 million</a> according to celebritynetworth.com.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'Sex And The City' Fans React To COVID-19 Being In The Reboot</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddna60ecBmn6KfmJq%2FbrrErWSwp6KptW65wK2roZ2nYq%2Bzu8OeqaKbm2K8s3nSmqmaoF2fsrS%2FyJyYZqiRp7imvo4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
