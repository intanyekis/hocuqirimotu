Just like last week, the promos very much have a Saturday Night’s Main Event vibe to them.</p><ul><li>MJF wins the match in under a minute with the Lebell Lock submission.</li></ul><p>MJF cuts a promo following the match and runs down the city of Hamilton and says he’ll defend his title tonight against anyone in the back from this city. An unknown big man comes out to challenge, but he’s cut off by Ethan Page who comes to the ring and asks for a microphone.</p><p>MJF tries to tell Page he’s not on his level and Page knocks the microphone out of his and says we aren’t doing this tonight in Hamilton. Page says he’s out there to remind MJF and everyone in the back what he’s capable of.</p><p>Ethan Page says he’s not on MJF’s level because he’s not a bare minimum bitch. Page says MJF isn’t his champion, he spoke about everything he does for All Elite Wrestling and says he knows that it will be paid back in due time.</p><p>Page tells MJF to be a man and do something for this company and put the title on the line against him. MJF agrees, we have a title match.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><ul><li>MJF hits the Heatseeker on Ethan Page to score the pinfall victory and retain his title.</li></ul><ul><li>Powerhouse Hobbs hits a second spinebuster on Dustin Rhodes to score the pinfall victory and advances to the semi-finals of the men’s Owen Hart Cup.</li></ul><p>A hype package plays for tonight’s main event match between Samoa Joe and Roderick Strong.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><ul><li>Miro applies the Game on Anthony Henry to win the match via submission.</li></ul><p>Tony Schiavone is in the ring and introduces Bullet Club Gold, which now officially includes The Gunns.

He starts making up new names for The Gunns like The Golden Gunns and The Topshelf Gunns.</p><p>White says Juice Robinson is gonna wipe the floor with Ricky Starks tonight. The Gunns try to explain why they joined Bullet Club Gold and the crowd responded by chanting “ass boys” at them. The Gunns say they are the best tag team in the world.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Schiavone informs Bullet Club Gold that they are barred from ringside for Juice Robinson’s match with Ricky Starks. White gets upset and said Schiavone isn’t allowed to talk anymore. White says he has something to say to CM Punk. White says Punk returned with a goodie in a bag and that’s quite tantalizing to him. He said if that is the AEW World Championship in his bag, he should leave it there.</p><p>White and Robinson challenge FTR for the AEW World Tag Team Titles. We go to the Tron where CM Punk, FTR, and Ricky Starks are in the locker room. Punk says if he wants to know what’s in the bag, he can go on ShopAEW and buy a title and call themselves a champion like MJF did.</p><p>FTR accepts the challenge of Jay White and Juice Robinson. Dax Harwood says Saturday nights are right for fighting. Starks predicts that without Bullet Club Gold at ringside, he’s going to advance in the Owen Hart Cup tournament tonight.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><ul><li>Ricky Starks hit a spear on Juice Robinson and rolled him up afterward to score the pinfall victory.</li></ul><p>Bullet Club Gold surrounds the ring after the match, which brings out CM Punk and FTR to make the save and chase them off.</p><p>Christian Cage and Luchasaurus are interviewed backstage. Cage is asked why he has the TNT Championship on his shoulder instead of Luchasaurus, before Cage can give an actual answer he’s interrupted by Shawn Spears.</p><p>Spears wants to talk to the champ so Cage says to talk to him. Cage says Spears has never seized on his opportunities and should walk away. Spears says everyone is capable of being dangerous, they just need to meet the right person. He tells Luchasaurus he’ll see him soon before he walks off.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><ul><li>Kris Statlander hit Saturday Night Fever on Lady Frost to retain her championship via pinfall.</li></ul><p>Andrade El Idolo is interviewed backstage about his recent altercations with The House of Black.
