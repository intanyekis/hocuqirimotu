Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>Victor Cruz, an American football player, made $8.6 million in salary and had a fortune of <strong>$20 million as of December 2022.</strong> Cruz and the Giants agreed to a five-year, $43 million contract agreement in June 2013. He had just completed his inaugural Pro Bowl campaign. Cruz’s three-year, $1.215 million deal with the New York Giants in 2010 was also brought up.</p><p>Victor Cruz was an outstanding football player for the New York Giants who routinely helped his team win games. His career was plagued by several setbacks, including the death of his father, a subpar grade, and the selectors’ refusal to recognize him. He also had to go through pain.</p><h2><span id=Where_was_Victor_Cruz_born_Ethnicity_Nationality_Family_Education>Where was Victor Cruz born? Ethnicity, Nationality, Family, Education</span></h2><p>On <strong>November 11, 1986,</strong> Victor Cruz was born in Paterson, New Jersey, in the USA. Victor Walker, the son of African-American firefighter Michael Walker and Puerto Rican-born Blanca Cruz, grew up in a drug- and gang-infested Paterson. Before this, he had said, “In the city, a lot of crime happened, a lot of violence happened occasionally,” and he later added, “Opportunities were few, especially for young guys of my race.” “Growing up in Patterson was not the simplest thing to do.”</p><p>His parents, who were never married and kept their son on a short leash, made sure he stayed out of trouble. Cruz’s mother and grandmother raised him most of the time, but his father gave him a lot of guidance and support, especially when it came to athletics.</p><p>When Cruz first enrolled at Paterson Catholic High School, he weighed just 165 pounds and stood 5’9″. He was an important player on the football field as a receiver and a kick returner.</p><p>However, because of his poor college grades, he was not given the chance to apply for any scholarships. Cruz attended Bridgton Academy in Maine after receiving his diploma in 2004 and spent a postgraduate year there to raise his academic standing and continue his football career.</p><h2><span id=Quick_Facts>Quick Facts</span></h2><table style=height:414px;width:100%><tbody><tr style=height:23px><td style=height:23px width=292><strong>Celebrated Name:</strong></td><td style=height:23px width=292>Victor Cruz</td></tr><tr style=height:23px><td style=height:23px width=292><strong>Real Name/Full Name:</strong></td><td style=height:23px width=292>Victor Michael Cruz</td></tr><tr style=height:23px><td style=height:23px width=292><strong>Gender:</strong></td><td style=height:23px width=292>Male</td></tr><tr style=height:23px><td style=height:23px width=292><strong>Age:</strong></td><td style=height:23px width=292>35 years old</td></tr><tr style=height:23px><td style=height:23px width=292><strong>Birth Date:</strong></td><td style=height:23px width=292>11 November 1986</td></tr><tr style=height:23px><td style=height:23px width=292><strong>Birth Place:</strong></td><td style=height:23px width=292>Paterson, New Jersey, United States</td></tr><tr style=height:23px><td style=height:23px width=292><strong>Nationality:</strong></td><td style=height:23px width=292>American</td></tr><tr style=height:23px><td style=height:23px width=292><strong>Height:</strong></td><td style=height:23px width=292>1.83 m</td></tr><tr style=height:23px><td style=height:23px width=292><strong>Weight:</strong></td><td style=height:23px width=292>93 kg</td></tr><tr style=height:23px><td style=height:23px width=292><strong>Sexual Orientation:</strong></td><td style=height:23px width=292>Straight</td></tr><tr style=height:23px><td style=height:23px width=292><strong>Marital Status:</strong></td><td style=height:23px width=292>In a relationship</td></tr><tr style=height:23px><td style=height:23px width=292><strong>Wife/Spouse (Name):</strong></td><td style=height:23px width=292>N/A</td></tr><tr style=height:23px><td style=height:23px width=292><strong>Children/Kids (Son and Daughter):</strong></td><td style=height:23px width=292>Yes (Kennedy Cruz)</td></tr><tr style=height:23px><td style=height:23px width=292><strong>Dating/Girlfriend (Name):</strong></td><td style=height:23px width=292>Yes (Elaina Watley m. 2003; div. 2014), Karrueche Tran (m. 2017)</td></tr><tr style=height:23px><td style=height:23px width=292><strong>Is&nbsp;</strong><strong>Victor Cruz Gay?:</strong></td><td style=height:23px width=292>No</td></tr><tr style=height:23px><td style=height:23px width=292><strong>Profession:</strong></td><td style=height:23px width=292>American football wide receiver, Analyst</td></tr><tr style=height:23px><td style=height:23px width=292><strong>Salary:</strong></td><td style=height:23px width=292>N/A</td></tr><tr style=height:23px><td style=height:23px width=292><strong>Net Worth in 2022:</strong></td><td style=height:23px width=292>$20 million</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span id=Is_Victor_Cruz_Single_Relationship>Is Victor Cruz Single?
