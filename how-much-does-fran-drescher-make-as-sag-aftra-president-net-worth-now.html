The Truth About Her Net Worth Now</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>Due to the summer 2023 SAG and WGA strikes, issues of AI, salary negotiations, and fair compensation are top of mind for pop culture fans. There's been a ton of controversy surrounding the strikes as well. This included when <a href=#>Kim Kardashian tweeted on the set of American Horror Story</a> instead of showing the writers that she was on their side. But much of the attention has fallen on the former star of The Nanny. There's no question that Fran Drescher, the President of SAG-AFTRA, is front and center.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Drescher has had a great career after The Nanny</a>, the 1990s sitcom that she is best known for. And now she is advocating for actors' rights. While everyone is talking about the low salaries that many actors have sadly received from streaming series, people are also curious about Fran Drescher's SAG-AFTRA salary...</p><h2 id=what-is-fran-drescher-39-s-sag-aftra-president-salary>What Is Fran Drescher's SAG-AFTRA President Salary?</h2><p>Whether she's talking about the <a href=#>unique way she fell in love with her ex-husband</a> Peter Marc Jacobson or the SAG strike, Fran Drescher can be counted on to be straightforward and truthful. And that's what makes her such an inspiring leader of the actors' union.</p><p>In September 2021, Fran Drescher won the SAG-AFTRA election and become the President. According to Variety, the previous President was Gabrielle Carteris, who is famous for playing Andrea Zuckerman on Beverly Hills 90210. Drescher won 52.5% of the vote. She beat Glee actor Matthew Modine, who got 47.5% of the vote.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fran-drescher-1923.jpg><p>In 2015, Deadline reported on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SAG-AFTRA employee salaries</a> at the time. This article helps paint a rough picture of what the staff members are paid annually. Deadline reported that David White, the National Executive Director, was going to be paid an annual salary of $600,485.</p><p>Deadline reported that Ken Howard, who was the SAG President from 2009 until he tragically passed away in 2016, didn't earn any money when he held the position. No one who wins a SAG-AFTRA election gets paid.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans Can't Believe This '90s Sitcom Star Made The Top 10 List Of Highest-Paid TV Actors</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Based on this article from Deadline, it's clear that Fran Drescher doesn't make money as the SAG-AFTRA President.</p><p>However, as Deadline reported, Howard was given $42,097 "in reimbursed expenses." It seems that this is true of every SAG President, including Drescher.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/how-much-does-fran-drescher-make-as-the-sag-aftra-president_-the-truth-about-her-net-worth-now.jpg><p>While the actress isn't making any money from her position, she does seem to care deeply about the cause that she is fighting for. It's not easy to hold this role and, when there's a strike, the President is the one making the rounds and talking to the press about what's going on. Drescher has settled into the job perfectly. She doesn't shy away from public speaking and has the confidence to speak up for what's right.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fran-drescher-1.jpg><p>In 2021, Drescher talked to Deadline about why she wanted to be the President. She explained, "I hope to unify our membership, to move us into the 21st century. I want us to be stronger, healthier and wealthier. It’s time to leverage our creative force for economic gain, to bring reason & fairness along with influence & strength to the negotiating table. I will always fight to strengthen benefits for ALL members."</p><h2 id=what-is-fran-drescher-39-s-net-worth>What Is Fran Drescher's Net Worth?</h2><p>When comparing <a href=#>the net worths of The Nanny actors</a>, Fran Drescher has the most amount of money. She has a net worth of $25 million. This makes it possible for her to be the SAG-ACTRA President and not receive a salary.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Drescher made a lot of money from The Nanny because she was a producer and writer on the sitcom. She and Peter Marc Jacobson were also the ones who created the series.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How '90s Sitcom Star Jo Marie Payton's Career Has Evolved</a></span></p><p>The actress played Fran Fine-Sheffield in all 146 episodes of The Nanny. She then played the main role Fran Lovett in the sitcom Happily Divorced, which aired for two seasons from 2011 to 2013. She acted throughout the 2000s and 2010s, which allowed her to keep making money. But it seems that she made the bulk of her net worth from The Nanny.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fran-drescher-2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the last few years, Fran Drescher has only acted a little bit. She starred in the TV movies Secrets of the Morning and The Christmas Setup. She must have done pretty well voicing the character of Eunice in the Hotel Transylvania film franchise.</p><h2 id=inside-fran-drescher-39-s-sag-aftra-strike-speech>Inside Fran Drescher's SAG-AFTRA Strike Speech</h2><p>In July 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fran Drescher talked about the SAG strike.</a> And her speech was so passionate and memorable that everyone kept talking about it for days.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fran-drescher-meredith-stiehm.jpg><p>Drescher said, “We are the victims here. We are being victimised by a very greedy entity. I am shocked by the way the people that we have been in business with are treating us. I cannot believe it, quite frankly, how far apart we are on so many things. How they plead poverty, that they’re losing money left and right when giving hundreds of millions of dollars to their CEOs. It is disgusting. Shame on them. They stand on the wrong side of history.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Is How Ryan Seacrest Spends His $450 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Every time she talks about the SAG and WGA strikes, Drescher sounds intelligent and also very relatable. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, she talked about the dangers of AI and said, "Why put somebody out of work? What’s wrong with these people? It’s not normal."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fran-drescher.jpg><p>She also told The Hollywood Reporter that SAG went on strike because prior discussions didn't go anywhere. She explained, "there was a strange resistance to accommodating our request to change the contract to accommodate the current business model, to honor the contributions of our members so that they’re making, not even what they made in 2020, but what they should be making for inflation today and for the next three years."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fran Drescher's inspiring words motivate everyone to keep fighting for what they deserve from Hollywood.
