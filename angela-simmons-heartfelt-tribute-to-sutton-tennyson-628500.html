The fatal shooting reportedly took place following an argument the businessman had with three other people.</p><p>While the 31-year-old Growing Up Hip Hop reality star <a href=# rel=noopener>shared a message</a> on Tennyson’s death back when it initially happened, she recently took to <a href=# id=auto-tag_instagram_1 data-tag=instagram>Instagram</a> to share another poignant note about him. With 2019 on the horizon, Simmons wanted to pay tribute to his legacy and reassure him that everything is going to be OK.</p><p>“As this year comes to a close … I reflect on the most difficult hurdle I’ve ever had to face. And it’s losing my son’s father,” she captioned the post. “To know that you are with us in spirit is sometimes just not enough. But as the new year comes in I know that I will do my best carrying Sj with your strength and mine. And now being mommy and daddy to our beautiful son . Thank you for my best gift ever. Sj will forever carry your name. Rest now . I got us ♥️💪🏽 2019 we are ready.”</p><p>The two called it quits back in 2016, after their child was born. Nonetheless, there’s no denying Tennyson’s death is a major loss for Simmons and her baby boy. “I’m hurting. I’m numb. Thank you for the outpouring of love everyone,” Simmons said back in November. “I can’t believe I’m even saying Rest In Peace Sutton. I promise to hold SJ down in every way I promise.”</p><p><strong>READ MORE:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Sutton Tennyson’s Alleged Murderer Turns Himself In</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5a7qLHLmmSsoZ2ivK%2B%2FjKGcmqqkm7KtwIytqaKapamybsDOZqqurKSku27AxKelsqufo3p3fpduZ2ln</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
