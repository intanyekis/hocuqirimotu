Investigators have not released a possible motive in his shooting or identified any suspects.</p><p>The coach’s murder comes as homicides in Los Angeles hit a 15-year high, according to ABC7. In the first half of the year, the city saw 181 murders – a 34% increase from the average number of murders during the same period between 2015 and 2019.</p><p>Working out of Fortune Gym in Los Angeles, Bennett had numerous celebrity clients such as Grillo, UFC fighter Jason “Mayhem” Miller and singers Kiana Ledé and Eddie Benjamin.</p><p>“Azuma was our family. One of the best of the best. We are all so heartbroken,” Fortune Gym said in a statement.</p><p>Bennett, from Australia, moved to the United States three years ago. A GoFundMe page was set up to raise money to repatriate Bennett’s body. It has raised more than $35,000 as of early Friday.</p><p>“Azuma was one of a kind. An outstanding athlete, fighter, teacher trainer and friend/companion to so many,” gym owner Tamara Fortune wrote in the GoFundMe page description. “We lost one of the best out there.”</p><p>“He didn’t deserve this,” Fortune added. “He was kind to everyone he met and always engaged everyone in the gym with his positive energy and engaging personality.”</p><p>#Marvel #star #Frank #Grillo #criticizes #Los #Angeles #crime #trainer #Azuma #Bennett #shot #killed #Aumag</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJrBorjKrKuonJGue6S7zGikmqqmmrluv9OaqWaeopa7rHnGq6ClpJ9isLO106KaorKVqHqtu9JmmKeflaGytHnCq6CmnV2Ws7Wx0Warq5mZo7KzecCzrKaZXZeyr7rEratmr5GoerS0zq1kmqaUYriquMuem2aZpaKuqHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
