This ban was a result of his “liking” a tweet related to the animated sitcom South Park, which had made controversial comments about China.</p><p>This incident highlighted the potential impact of social media and public statements on an artist’s career and global recognition. DJs and musicians, like Zedd, are increasingly subject to scrutiny for their online activities and public opinions. In this digital age, it is essential for artists to be mindful of the potential consequences of their social media engagement, as it can have far-reaching effects on their professional lives.</p><p>“Social media has the power to amplify messages and opinions in an instant.
