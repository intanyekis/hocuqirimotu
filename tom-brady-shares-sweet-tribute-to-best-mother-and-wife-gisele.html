They enjoyed a second wedding in Costa Rica about six weeks later with 25 guests.</p><p>In his gushing tribute to the 41-year-old on Saturday, Brady continued, “I love you more now than I ever could have imagined. You are the best mother and wife and supporter in the world and I am blessed to call you my wife. Te amo muito meu amor, happy anniversary @gisele.”</p><p>The former Victoria’s Secret angel, who shares <a href=#>son Benjamin, 12, and daughter Vivian, 9</a>, with her husband, shared the same throwback photo from their wedding day. “Happy anniversary love of my life! Te amo! ❤️ @tombrady,” she captioned the snap via Instagram.</p><p>This is the pair’s first anniversary since Brady retired from football at the beginning of the month. “I have loved my NFL career, and now it is time to focus my time and energy on other things that require my attention,” he wrote, in part, via Instagram on February 1.</p><p>The quarterback spent 22 years in the NFL playing for the New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He won seven Super Bowls and was named MVP five times. He went on to <a href=#>thank many of his teammates</a> and colleagues before mentioning his family in the retirement announcement.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“And lastly to my wife, Gisele, and my children, Jack, Benny and Vivi. You are my inspiration,” he concluded. “Our family is my greatest achievement. I always came off the field and home to the most <a href=#>loving and supportive wife</a> who has done EVERYTHING for our family to allow me to focus on my career. Her selflessness allowed me to reach new heights professionally, and I am beyond words what you mean to me and our family.”</p><p>The Brazil native <a href=#>shared her support</a> on social media after the news made headlines. “What an incredible ride this has been!” Bündchen commented via Instagram at the time. “You know that we are always here to support you my love. Looking forward to what the future holds. Te amo.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatp51ir7Otw7JkrKCRp7K0edKwnJ6sXam%2Fqq7UrZxmrJ9ir6a%2F02akqKyYmr9urc2dZLChlpp6qLXSnqOeZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
