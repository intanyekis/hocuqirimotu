He also added a spiky wig and cigarette to complete the look.</p><p>Spungen dated Vicious until her October 1978 death at age 20 from a stab wound.

Sex Pistols lead singer <strong>John Lydon</strong> (a.k.a. Johnny Rotten) later called the film “the lowest form of life,” but it has since developed a cult following.</p><p>Despite the real couple’s dark end, Kardashian and Barker’s looks received plenty of praise from their Instagram followers. “How?!
