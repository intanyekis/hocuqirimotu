The Real Time with Bill Maher host has been incredibly outspoken on the subject over the years, <a href=#>leaving no doubt that he intends to remain a bachelor for life</a>. Curiously, the now 69-year-old’s disdain for marriage doesn’t extend to romantic relationships.</p><p>“I mean, I’ve tried to have relationships,” he said during a June 2019 appearance on The Howard Stern Show. “I’ve been in love. I’ve known some amazing [women]. But I never understood how you can be with the same person, just day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year.”</p><p>The comedian has had a slew of romantic relationships over the years, most of which have ended acrimoniously. His least controversial relationship happens to be with Canadian singer-songwriter Anjulie Persaud, to whom he was first romantically linked in 2014. So, is the duo's relationship still going strong, or have they parted ways in the decade since they were first linked together?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-is-bill-maher-rsquo-s-alleged-girlfriend-anjulie-persaud>Who Is Bill Maher’s Alleged Girlfriend Anjulie Persaud?</h2><p>Anjulie Persaud has been romantically linked to renowned comedian Bill Maher since 2014, but that’s not her only claim to fame. Popularly known as Anjulie, the Canadian-born singer-songwriter is best known for her hit song 'Boom,' which has featured in everything from HBO’s The Hills to The CW’s Melrose Place and The Vampire Diaries.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/anjulie-persaud.jpg><p>Born and raised in the quaint suburbs of Oakville, Ontario, Anjulie became obsessed with music at a pretty early age, and was already composing her own music by the time she hit her teen years. The now 40-year-old’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">musical journey then led her to the streets of New York</a>, where she boldly started playing guitar “in the subways and lobbies of record companies until somebody listened.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fortuitously, her efforts did not go to waste. By 2010, the once-unfamed Anjulie had already released her self-titled debut album, and shared the stage with musical legends like Jesse McCartney, Shwayze, and Hedley.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/is-bill-maher-still-dating-alleged-girlfriend-anjulie-persaud_-here-s-the-truth-about-their-relationship-now.jpg><p>Anjulie has also written and produced hits for musical heavyweights like Nicki Minaj, Lady Gaga, Zedd, Lea Michele, Kelly Clarkson, Angel Haze, and Boombox Cartel. The now 40-year-old currently works as a music supervisor at HBO, and was even responsible for producing the theme song for Real Time with Bill Maher.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Howard Stern Didn't Mind Bill Maher's Live Audience, But Revealed Why He Refuses To Do Interviews With A Crowd In Studio</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Anjulie is also a passionate advocate for women's rights, using her music to amplify important messages.

Months later, the two were spotted vacationing together in the sunny beaches of Maui, but haven’t been spotted out and about since then.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/bill-maher.jpg><p>So, is the twosome still going strong, or has their relationship unraveled in the decade since they were first romantically linked? Well, while news of a split has not surfaced,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Maher did make some rather cryptic remarks about his love life</a> during a 2019 interview with Howard Stern that could offer some insight into his current status with Anjulie.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Howard Stern Roasted Bill Maher's Bad Reputation In Hollywood After The Real Time Host Bashed His Wife, Beth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When asked if he had a serious girlfriend, Maher replied, "I don't need a girlfriend," but then intriguingly followed up with, "Depends on what you mean by girlfriend." As Stern probed further, inquiring if there was someone special he adored, Maher chose to give an equally cryptic response. "Yes, but it's not one person, and that's where we're different."</p><p>The cryptic remarks left viewers guessing about his relationship status, and whether his alleged decade-long romance with Anjulie was still going strong.</p><h2 id=are-bill-maher-and-anjulie-persaud-ever-getting-married>Are Bill Maher And Anjulie Persaud Ever Getting Married?</h2><p>If Anjulie Persaud and Bill Maher are still dating, their relationship will be the longest in the comedian’s colorful dating history. However, despite its longevity, it's highly unlikely that the relationship will evolve into a marriage.</p><p>Maher and Anjulie appear to be charting their own unique path, fueled by a fervent desire for independence and a shared aversion to traditional matrimony.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/bill-maher-performing.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Maher has been unwaveringly vocal about his aversion to marriage throughout his decades-long career. The now 69-year-old’s views on the subject have even found a place on his website.</p><p>“I'm the last of my guy friends to have never gotten married, and their wives—they don't want them playing with me,” his website reads. “I'm like the escaped slave—I bring news of freedom.”</p><p>Maher elaborated on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">why he’s been reluctant to take the plunge into matrimony</a> in an April 2022 interview with Club Random Podcast. "I've always been married to my career. Any woman would always have to be a mistress to that. I mean, that's just the way it is,” he said. “I think I was hurt when I was in highschool, dumped by my first high school girlfriend, and I think at that moment something in me went ‘Don’t ever put your eggs in that basket for happiness.’”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>During His Appearance On The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, Bill Maher Admitted He And The Host Are Complete Opposites</a></span></p><p>Anjulie’s perspective on wedlock seems equally unconventional, as hinted in her ‘No Wifey’ lyrics. “You say you don’t need no wifey; So why you keep tryna wife me,” she sings. “See I never been the type see; I’m sliding I’m swerving I’m hustlin I’m workin on; Me I’m bad as can be love; Me I’m all that I need love; Me I’m fancy and free love; Me I’m never gone never gone be no wifey; Baby I don’t need a diamond; Cos I’m already a diamond.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigrGWSnrmtecyan56qXZmutbXNoGSgoaKhs7O1xKebZpmen8KttcRmp56qo5bCpXnNqK5o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
