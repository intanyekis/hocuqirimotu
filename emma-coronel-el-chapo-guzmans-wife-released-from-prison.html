The cartel’s hitmen kidnapped, tortured, and killed members of rival gangs to consolidate its power.</p><p>The Sinaloa cartel also bribed police officers and high-ranking politicians in Mexico and across Central America to turn a blind eye to drug shipments or even tip the cartel off about impending raids.</p><p>Emma Coronel first met Guzmán when she was 17 years old and competing in a local beauty pageant.</p><p>Her father, Inés Coronel, was a high-ranking member of the Sinaloa cartel who is currently serving a 10-year sentence in Mexico for drug smuggling.</p><p>Guzmán was running the cartel from various hideouts in northern Mexico after he had escaped from prison in a laundry cart in 2001.</p><p>They formalized their relationship in a ceremony when Emma Coronel was 18 – although it is not clear if their marriage was ever officially registered with the Mexican authorities.</p><p>Coronel, who holds dual US-Mexican nationality, traveled to California in 2011 to give birth to the couple’s twin daughters, a move which means the children have US citizenship.</p><p>In 2014, Guzmán was arrested after a 13-year manhunt and sent to the Altiplano maximum security jail in Mexico.</p><p>It only took Guzmán 17 months to escape again, this time using a motorcycle on rails which led to a nearby warehouse. At her trial, prosecutors said Coronel had played a key role in her husband’s escape.</p><p>She was also accused of having acted as a messenger for her husband both during his time on the run and behind bars, relaying orders to his cartel lieutenants and to his sons with his previous wives, who are known as the Chapitos (Little Chapos).</p><p>After his 2015 tunnel escape, Guzmán managed to evade capture for six months before Mexican special forces finally captured him outside Los Mochis, in his home state of Sinaloa.</p><p>He was extradited to the US a year later and put on trial in New York.</p><p>Coronel made daily appearances in the Brooklyn courtroom.</p><p>Immaculately dressed and perfectly groomed, she smiled and waved to him from the public gallery. She told the New York Times that she did not recognize the gruesome testimony given about her husband in court, instead describing him as “an excellent father, friend, brother, son, partner”.</p><p>When Guzmán was found guilty in February 2019, the couple gave each other the thumbs up.</p><p>Coronel remained free for almost another two years until her arrest at Dulles airport, near Washington DC, in February 2021.</p><p>Prosecutors said she was well aware of her husband’s criminal activities and “understood the scope of the Sinaloa cartel’s drug trafficking”.</p><p>She pleaded guilty to drug trafficking and money laundering.</p><p>At her sentencing, Coronel asked for leniency for the sake of her children. “I beg you to not allow them to grow up without the presence of a mother,” she told the judge.</p><p>She was sentenced to three years in jail which were subsequently reduced, paving the way for today’s release.</p><p>Her future plans are unclear, but her husband’s letter pleading for her to be allowed to see him would suggest she may travel to Oregon to visit him.</p><p>In the letter, Guzmán says the couple’s daughters, who are now 12 years old, are “studying in Mexico and can only travel to visit their dad during the holidays, two or three times per year at most”.</p><p><strong>By BBC</strong></p><b>Email your news TIPS to Editor@kahawatungu.com or WhatsApp +254707482874</b><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmijkZ2uuK3TrqWgrV6YvK57xKakmmWTpL%2BwusSlZJ6kXZi1orzOZp6usp2Wu7R51qKdnmWimrmmrdKem2aeoqS6brzRoqqopl8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
