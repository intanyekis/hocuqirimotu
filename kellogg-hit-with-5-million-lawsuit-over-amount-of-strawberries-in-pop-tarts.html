She claims she was enticed to purchase the company’s Strawberry Pop-tarts under the misassumption the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">breakfast</a> treat contains more nutritious ingredients than it actually does.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Farewell, Bobby: Bobby Flay To Leave The Food Network After 27 Years</a></span></p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mass Live</a>, Harris is specifically upset about an advertisement that says Kellogg’s Strawberry Pop-Tarts celebrate the 'timeless yet yummy' flavor of strawberries. She also says a recipe for strawberry shortcake on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pop-Tart’s website</a> made her believe they use real fruits in their products.</p><p>However, upon reviewing the Strawberry Pop-Tart ingredients, Harris was shocked to learn that only 2% or less of the product is made from real, dried <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fruit</a> such as strawberries, pears, and apples.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kellogg uses Red 40, a synthetic food dye, to give the Pop-Tarts a vibrant red look, which the lawsuit claims only furthers the misassumption that real fruits are the primary ingredient in the product.</p><p>Harris’ lawsuit argues that similar products sold by brands like Walmart’s Great Value and Dollar Tree’s Clover Valley incorporate disclaimers on their packaging to emphasize they use both natural and artificial flavors. Harris hopes Kellogg will take a similar, more honest approach when branding its products moving forward.</p><p><a href=#>USA Today </a>notes that Harris is invoking the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act in her lawsuit, which states that misrepresentation or concealment in advertising is illegal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So far, Kellogg has not returned the press’s requests for comment. The company originally introduced Pop-Tarts in 1964 as a line of convenient toaster pastries, designed to make breakfasts tastier and more convenient. The pastries feature a sugary filling kept together by two layers of a crunchy, pastry crust.</p><p>Kellogg’s Pop-Tarts come in a variety of flavors, including mango, blueberry, and chocolate, as well as certain limited-edition varieties, such as a fall-themed pumpkin spice flavor.</p><p>The pastries are one of the Kellogg’s best-selling products to date. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">It was previously reported</a> that, in 2001, the number of Pop-Tarts sold could stretch half-way to the moon or across the United States 52 times.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kellogg reportedly has $17.7 billion in total assets, so a $5 million lawsuit may only make a small dent in their revenue. In addition to Pop-Tarts, the food manufacturing company is also known for brands like Eggo, Cheez-It, Nutri-Grain, and Rice Krispies Treats, and cereals such as Corn Flakes, Froot Loops, Special K, and many more.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adele Is Releasing A New Album Inspired By Her Divorce</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mass Live</a>, <a href=#>USA Today</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wayback Machine</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pop-Tarts</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS4prjLqJ6gZZiewW7DyK2fZm1doratuMiopWakkazAtrXTZqavnaJirq671KerZqeWYsC1vsCwmZ6qop6ytHnIp2Spp6BiwaK%2B06xm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
