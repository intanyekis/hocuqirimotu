The outing was in honor of Khloe’s daughter True’s 4th birthday.

The luxurious package gives guests priority access, likely implying they can skip the notoriously long lines.</p><p>The VIP package also comes with a personal guide who promises to pay attention to your group’s needs while providing a tour complete with insider tips and stories.</p><p>Photos of the Kardashians show the family hopping on a variety of rides during their afternoon out. However, the outing wasn’t without controversy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since photos were published, Kim and Khloe have come under fire for skipping lines and hogging rides while regular guests were forced to wait their turn.</p><p>Mother and fellow Disney guest Rachael Kevin <a href=#>uploaded a video to TikTok</a> detailing her experience seeing the Kardashians at the theme park. In the video, she shows how Kim, Khloe, and their group were allowed on the tea cup rides by themselves – leaving many of the cups empty.</p><p>“When the Kardashians cut the line, get the ride to themselves, and make us common folk wait and watch them… typical,” text on the video read.</p><p>“It seemed like forever,” Rachael continued. “We finally got on 30 minutes later.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As <a href=#>Buzzfeed</a> points out, not every celebrity demands the VIP treatment – or at least, fully empty rides – when visiting Disneyland. Recently, footage of <a href=#>Cardi B enjoying the teacup ride</a> with her entourage went viral. The rapper can be seen riding in the cups alongside other park guests.</p><p>The Kardashian’s Disneyland outing wasn’t the only big thing they did to celebrate True’s birthday. The toddler also had a cat-themed party attended by her famous cousins. Photos from the event show the kids in face paint as well as an adopt-a-(stuffed)-cat station, likely party favors for the kids.</p><p>Only a few months ago, the Kardashians threw an equally epic joint birthday party for Chicago and Stormi, the eldest child of Kylie Jenner, both of whom turned 4-years old. The girls had a Barbie and LOL Dolls-themed bash filled with elaborate pink décor, a bouncy castle, and a ball pit.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Emily Ratajkowski Settles Copyright Lawsuit After Posting Pic Of Herself</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: <a href=#>TMZ</a>, <a href=#>Disneyland</a>, <a href=#>Buzzfeed</a>, <a href=#>TikTok</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8qaqZ2Zo522orqMr6CpZaSnsqLAzJ6lrWWUnsCvsdilmKecXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
