Jordan Flashed Awkward Moment Pals Zac Efron, Miles Teller</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>That awkward moment when your costar takes off his towel and has absolutely nothing underneath… <strong>Michael B. Jordan</strong> was supposed to be wearing a modesty sock while filming a scene in That Awkward Moment where he shows <strong>Miles Teller</strong> and <a href=#><strong>Zac Efron</strong></a> his nether regions — there's a reason for it in the movie — but as a practical joke of sorts, he decided to just go commando and flash them the real deal.</p><p>"I said, 'F–k it. Why not make it awkward on them?'" Jordan, 26, joked with <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a> at the L.A. premiere of the comedy on Monday, Jan. 27. "I was fine! I was completely comfortable."</p><p>Indeed, Teller told <strong>Us</strong> at the same event that his costar was perfectly happy going au natural — especially if it rattled his buds. "You know, Michael B. is very comfortable walking around on set naked," the Spectacular Now star, also 26, quipped. "It's a lot to deal with when you've just met a guy, but, yes, he enjoys taking his pants off."&nbsp;</p><p>As does Teller, apparently. "I mean, it wasn't appropriate for my character, so I didn't, but I'll moon people," he told <strong>Us</strong>. "I think mooning is really funny and I think it should come back."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>That said, messing with someone's mind can be just as entertaining. "Every day on set when we had a comedic scene, I looked in [Michael B.'s] eyes and said, 'I know you're scared because you've only done drama,'" Teller told <strong>Us</strong> of Jordan, who is known for more serious roles in Fruitvale Station, Friday Night Lights, and The Wire. "I said, 'But don't worry about it. Hold my hand, little girl.'"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGamoZOdrqa4jJtko6eima6vecWlmKyglZl6qbXSZqGupptiwbB506GYrWWRrLi4rdGdZKannZq7tXnCqKqtmaKoerutwmacn6qfo3qiusNmpKKklah6tbHLpZyrZZGoeqJ5z6uYnKyZmK6tecmoop5lYmV%2BdX6YamY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
