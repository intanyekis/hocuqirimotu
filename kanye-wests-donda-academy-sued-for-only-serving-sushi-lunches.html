The school also didn’t have an on-site nurse, medical supplies, or protocols around bullying.</p><p>Moreover, the lawsuit claims the quality of food being served to the children was concerning. The children were allegedly only offered sushi at lunch on a daily basis and made to eat on the floor, not tables.</p><p>The students were also prohibited from bringing any outside food or drinks onto the campus, except for water.</p><p>“We are responsible to make sure that we’re giving children a quality education, and when you don’t, you are really disturbing the life of that child,” Hailey went on. “That’s just not right.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Donda Academy has been met with controversy since Kanye opened the school in 2022, largely due to its uncredited status.</p><p>In October, an email was sent to the parents of students <a href=#>announcing the academy would be shutting down</a> for the remainder of the school year. "At the discretion of our Founder, Donda Academy will close for the remainder of the 2022-2023 school year effective immediately,” it said. “THERE IS NO SCHOOL TOMORROW."</p><p>However, only hours later, Kanye issued an email retracting the previous statement, and saying that school was back on.</p><p>The lawsuit against Kanye and Donda Academy remains ongoing, but it’s not the only one the rapper has been recently hit with. He’s currently fighting a $250 million defamation case filed by George Floyd’s family last year as well as a civil suit filed by his former manager over unpaid wages.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Kris Jenner & Khloe Kardashian Finish Constructing Side-By-Side Mansion</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>The Los Angeles Times</a>, <a href=#>TMZ</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS4orrYnmSwnaOpwG6wzqebmmWRmK6lscyyZKytlZl6p7vRZqanpKliwKa%2B1aKloGWjqsCptYylrKebmJrAcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
