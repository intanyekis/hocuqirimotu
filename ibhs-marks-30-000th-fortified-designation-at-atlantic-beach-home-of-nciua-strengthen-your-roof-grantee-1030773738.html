The home's resilient roof was funded in part by the <i>Strengthen Your Roof </i>program operated by the North Carolina Insurance Underwriting Association (NCIUA) and meets the stringent resilience requirements of the FORTIFIED program.&nbsp;</p><p xmlns=https://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml>Based on research by IBHS, FORTIFIED is a voluntary set of above-code design, building, and retrofitting steps that strengthen homes against severe weather. It has shown in lab research and during real-world events to reduce wind damage and prevent water intrusion during a storm. NCIUA adopted the standard as its benchmark for hurricane-resilience in 2017. <span class=xn-location>North Carolina's</span> FORTIFIED numbers have since grown exponentially, and it now ranks second nationally with more than 3,000 homes built or roofed to the standard.</p><p xmlns=https://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml>"The commitment by NCIUA to help homeowners minimize storm damage is the type of forward-thinking policymaking that will help entire communities bounce back faster from hurricanes like Florence, Dorian, and Isaias that batter the <span class=xn-location>North Carolina</span> coast year after year," said IBHS President and CEO <span class=xn-person>Roy Wright</span>. "It is not fate alone that determines which homes are devastated by hurricanes. The decisions we make as we build and re-roof our homes play a significant role in how we weather a storm."</p><p xmlns=https://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml>NCIUA, in partnership with the Institute for Advanced Analytics at <span class=xn-org>North Carolina State University</span>, has completed an analysis of the effectiveness of IBHS FORTIFIED Roofs in <span class=xn-location>North Carolina</span> using claims data from Hurricanes Matthew, Florence, Dorian and Isaias.&nbsp;The study concluded that policyholders with an IBHS FORTIFIED Roof were 35 percent less likely to experience a claim.&nbsp;And, if the policyholder with the IBHS FORTIFIED Roof did experience a claim, the claim resulted in 22 percent less damage.</p><p xmlns=https://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml>NCIUA has several pilot programs to assist eligible policyholders&nbsp;obtain a FORTIFIED Roof. NCIUA (1) pays the cost for an IBHS evaluator for policyholders who are electing to replace their roofs; (2) provides an enhancement coverage endorsement to over 125,000 policyholders that gives &nbsp;up to a <span class=xn-money>$5,000</span> benefit if a roof must be replaced due to a total loss; and (3) provides grants up to <span class=xn-money>$6,000</span> for policyholders on the Outer Banks and Barrier Islands to install a FORTIFIED Roof.</p><p xmlns=https://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml><span class=xn-person>Mike Causey</span>, North Carolina Insurance Commissioner said, "Since being sworn in <span class=xn-chron>January 2017</span>, it has been an honor to work with NCIUA on developing these pilot programs to help our coastal residents.&nbsp;We have over 3,000 homeowners along the <span class=xn-location>North Carolina</span> coast with an IBHS Fortified Roof. My goal as Insurance Commissioner is to make sure our coastal areas retain their beauty and strength while keeping <span class=xn-location>North Carolina</span> residents safe. I commend those who have participated in one of the programs for taking positive steps to strengthen their roofs so that we build more resilient coastal communities."</p><p xmlns=https://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml><span class=xn-person>Gina Hardy</span>, NCIUA CEO commented, "NCIUA has invested over <span class=xn-money>$22 million</span> to improve the resilience of our coastal communities. Eliminating or minimizing storm damage allows our policyholders to return home after a storm and quickly restore their lives. Additionally, our pilot programs help local contractors while reducing the impact of a storm on the local economy. In 2021, NCIUA is pleased to be investing up to another <span class=xn-money>$25 million</span> in the program."&nbsp;</p><p xmlns=https://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml>"For every home that is FORTIFIED, a family is safer, and their lives are less disrupted from the effects of a destructive storm. I am committed to helping Commissioner Causey and NCIUA look for ways to expand the pilot program to serve even more coastal policyholders," said <span class=xn-location>North Carolina</span> Representative <span class=xn-person>Pat McElraft</span>.</p><p xmlns=https://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml>Currently, homeowners receiving&nbsp;NCIUA <i>Strengthen Your Roof</i>&nbsp;grants are subject to federal taxes, but NCIUA is supporting legislation introduced in the U.S. Senate by <span class=xn-location>North Carolina</span> Senators <span class=xn-person>Richard Burr</span> and <span class=xn-person>Thom Tillis</span> (S. 2432) and the U.S. House of Representatives (HR 4675) with the support of <span class=xn-location>North Carolina</span> Congressman <span class=xn-person>David Rouzer</span> (NC-7). The proposed law would eliminate federal taxation on the grants.</p><p xmlns=https://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml>North Carolina Insurance Commissioner <span class=xn-person>Mike Causey</span>, who endorses the legislation, stated, "This legislation is needed to protect <span class=xn-location>North Carolina</span> residents who receive <i>Strengthen Your Roof </i>grants from having to pay federal income tax on the grant money they receive. This bipartisan legislation ensures&nbsp;that state-based disaster mitigation grants, including those from insurers like NCIUA, receive the same federal tax exemptions as federal mitigation grants and help provide greater incentives for homeowners to take action to protect their homes from natural disasters.&nbsp;</p><p xmlns=https://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml>The special ceremony celebrating IBHS's 30,000th FORTIFIED designation was held at the <span class=xn-location>Atlantic Beach</span> home of <span class=xn-person>James and Trish Moss</span>. <span class=xn-person>Gina Hardy</span>, CEO, NCIUA; <span class=xn-person>Mike Causey</span>, Commissioner, North Carolina Department of Insurance; <span class=xn-person>Joe Stewart</span>, Vice President of Government Affairs for Independent Insurance Agents of <span class=xn-location>North Carolina</span>; <span class=xn-person>Julie Shiyou-Woodard</span>, President and CEO, Smart Home America; <span class=xn-person>Spencer Rogers</span>, Director, North Carolina Sea Grant were in attendance.</p><p xmlns=https://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml>For more information about the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety or for tips and information about making your home more resilient to severe weather visit <a href=# rel=nofollow>www.disastersafety.org</a> or follow us on <a href=# rel=nofollow>Facebook</a> and <a href=# rel=nofollow>Twitter</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p xmlns=https://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml><b><i><u>About Strengthen Your Roof</u></i></b><i><u>&nbsp;</u></i></p><p xmlns=https://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml>The <i>Strengthen Your Roof</i> program is designed to improve the resiliency and weather-resistance of properties insured by NCIUA.
