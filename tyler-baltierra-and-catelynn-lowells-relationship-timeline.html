From middle school sweethearts to married MTV stars, <a href=#><strong>Catelynn Lowell</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Tyler Baltierra</strong></a> are committed to making their relationship work.</p><p>After more than a decade together, the couple has overcome many ups and downs, including breakups, makeups, <a href=#>living apart</a> and becoming parents.</p><p>After meeting in the 7th grade, the pair began dating in 2005. Their journey to parenthood was documented on MTV’s <a href=#>16 and Pregnant</a> in 2009, when Lowell gave birth to their daughter Carly. The pair placed Carly up for adoption, and despite how hard the decision was for them they have remained bonded.</p><p>Baltierra proposed to his love two times, once in high school in 2010 and again in 2013, after briefly calling off their first engagement. Two years later, the lovebirds welcomed their second child together, <a href=#>daughter Novalee</a>, in January 2015. Seven months later, they tied the knot after dating on and off for 10 years.</p><p>“I was bawling like a baby,” Baltierra exclusively told Us Weekly <a href=#>after the August 2015 nuptials</a>. The duo faced breakup rumors three years later, but Lowell denied a split was in their future, telling Us in May 2018, “Couples go through ups and downs. We are a solid couple.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Teen Mom</a> stars later welcomed daughter Vaeda in February 2019, after suffering a miscarriage a year prior. The rainbow baby also came after Lowell went public about <a href=#>her battle with mental illness</a> after seeking treatment.</p><p>“He’s obviously just as happy as I am,” Lowell told Us in September 2018 about her husband, <a href=#>ahead of their third daughter’s arrival</a>. “We love being parents and can’t wait for our newest addition.”</p><p>Baltierra agreed with his wife, telling Us, “After the initial shock wore off, I starting getting excited due to the fact that the universe obviously wanted this baby to come into the world no matter what! And after the miscarriage, this is truly a blessing … like every child!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The MTV personalities <a href=#>announced in February 2021</a> that they are going to be parents once again after Lowell suffered a miscarriage the year prior. They welcomed <a href=#>daughter Rya Rose</a> in August of that year.</p><p>Scroll down to relive the reality stars’ relationship ups and downs:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkwbq4xKtkm5mcqbamvtGaZJqmlGKwosDEpbCnpl2hvLixy6WqZqqVoa61tc6nqqGhoGLBqrnEpaCnnV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
