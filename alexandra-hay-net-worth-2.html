She was a native of Los Angeles, California, and graduated from Arroyo High School in El Monte.Hay's first credited role was in episode 27 of The Monkees titled "Monkee Mother" (original airdate March 20, 1967). In the episode, The Monkees lack of funds has them sharing their apartment with Milly Rudnick (played by Rose Marie) a kindly, but pushy, foster mother figure to the boys. Milly, trying to play matchmaker, brings back the attractive, blonde and elegant-looking Hays (wheeling her in a shopping cart no less) as Clarisse, who happens to be English like Davy (Davy Jones). Clarisse declares that she is "shaky all over to meet such a close friend of Rex Harrison's" intimating that Millie has told Clarisse that Davy is a close friend of Rex Harrison's even though he told Milly earlier he "never had the pleasure of meeting" Mr. Harrison. Then, in a sort of fantasy flash to Davy and Clarisse in evening clothes on the spiral staircase of the boys' apartment, Clarisse asks Davy if he really knows Rex Harrison; Davy says no and she claims "I don't care". Davy continues by outlining some of his faults to Clarisse but she answers each one with the same line ("I don't care") until he finally declares his love for the girl and her response is to toss her head and repeat blandly "I don't care." Her career continued with a few small roles in the movies Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (Spencer Tracy's final film) and The Ambushers (starring Dean Martin as secret agent Matt Helm).In 1968, she co-starred with James Garner and Debbie Reynolds in the romantic comedy How Sweet It Is! as Gloria, and in Otto Preminger's film Skidoo, as a young girl who discovers her car-dealer father (Jackie Gleason) is actually a onetime Mafia assassin. John Phillip Law played Stash, her hippie boyfriend. She and Law were re-teamed later, in 1971's The Love Machine, based on a Jacqueline Susann novel. She also starred in the 1969 film Model Shop as the live-in girlfriend of an aimless young man (George, played by Gary Lockwood). She appeared in the films 1000 Convicts and a Woman (1971) and The One Man Jury (1978).Hay had television roles in episodes of Mission: Impossible, Love, American Style, Dan August, Kojak, The Streets of San Francisco, and Police Story. Later movies included 1000 Convicts and a Woman, That Girl from Boston, and The One Man Jury, and she appeared in a television movie, The F.B.I. Story: The FBI Versus Alvin Karpis, Public Enemy Number One. She was also featured in a February 1974 pictorial in Playboy magazine titled "Alexandra the Great."Hay died in 1993, age 46, of arteriosclerotic heart disease. She was cremated, and her ashes were scattered off the coast of Marina del Rey, California. ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=2><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$7 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>1947-07-24</td></tr><tr><td>Died</td><td>1993-10-11</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actress</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Nicknames</td><td>Alexandra Hay, Hay, Alexandra</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Actress <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=actress readability=1.5><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>The Strip</td><td>2002</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Shop Assistant</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Another Time, Another Place</td><td>1992</td><td></td><td>June Michels</td></tr></table><h3>Known for movies</h3><figure class=gallery-item readability=1.5><p>Another Time, Another Place 1992<br>as June Michels</p></figure><figure class=gallery-item readability=1><p>The Strip 2002<br>as Shop Assistant</p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjqecrWWnpL%2B1tI6ao56wkaOxs62MoZiyZZ6awW7DzquroWViZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
