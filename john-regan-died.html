He played bass in Ace Frehley’s solo band from ’84-’90, so i only got to see him play with Ace a couple of times. He was a staple at KISS conventions in the 90s, so I got to chat with him a few times, and he was always super nice and happy to answer any nerdy KISS/Frehley’s Comet questions anyone may have had. Even though he probably didn’t remember me, he’d wish me a happy birthday on Facebook every year, as he probably did everybody on his friends list because he was just a nice guy.
