Drawing inspiration from Warcraft…</p><p>League of Legends was developed by Riot Games to expand on the success of a custom map called Defense of the Ancients in 2009. The game has a free-to-play model, with revenue coming from the sale of character customization items. League of Legends is compatible with both Microsoft Windows and macOS.</p><p>In the game, two teams of five players battle each other in exciting player-versus-player combat. Each team must defend and control their respective halves of the map. Players take on the role of “champions,” who have unique abilities and playstyles. Champions grow stronger during the match by gaining experience points, collecting gold, and purchasing items to outsmart their opponents. The main mode, Summoner’s Rift, requires teams to breach the enemy’s defenses and destroy their central structure, the “Nexus,” to win.</p><p>League of Legends has garnered critical acclaim for its accessibility, engaging character designs, and high-quality production. While the game’s reputation has improved, it still faces criticism for the toxic behavior of some players, an issue that Riot Games is actively working to address. The game’s popularity has soared, reaching a peak of eight million concurrent players in 2019, leading to various collaborations like music videos, comics, short stories, and the animated series Arcane. The success of League of Legends has also spawned spin-off games such as League of Legends: Wild Rift (for mobile), Legends of Runeterra (a digital card game), and Ruined King: A League of Legends Story (a turn-based RPG).</p><p>Regarded as one of the greatest video games, League of Legends has evolved into a global sport, with numerous regional leagues culminating in the prestigious annual League of Legends World Championship. In 2019, the championship attracted over 100 million unique viewers, with a peak of 44 million concurrent viewers during the finals. Tournaments are streamed on platforms like Twitch, YouTube, and Bilibili, as well as broadcast on sports channels like ESPN. The game’s widespread acclaim and competitive scene have cemented its status as a groundbreaking force in the gaming industry.</p><p>*Disclaimer*: The information provided above is for general informational purposes only.
