Her performance helped her earn a Saturn Award in 2009. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>She has also received praise for her role as Rebecca Harris in the CBS series Limitless, and Erica Shepherd in the NBC drama The Enemy Within. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Carpenter's Early Career</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The Juilliard&nbsp;alum landed in the film industry with a small guest appearance in 2002’s film People Are Dead. She continued playing minor roles in movies like <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Ash Tuesday, D.E.B.S., White Chicks, and Lethal Eviction in the following years.</p><p>On September 5, 2005, Carpenter <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">appeared as Emily Rose</a>, the protagonist, in the horror-thriller The Exorcism of Emily Rose.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Her performance was praised by critics, and she went on to win several awards, including the MTV Movie Award for Best Frightened Performance, Hollywood Life Breakthrough Award, and Breakout Performer at the Scream Awards. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>After that, the actress never looked back as she has been regularly working in movies and TV shows.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>‘Dexter’ Was Her Breakthrough Television Project</h2><p>Carpenter took on the role of Debra Morgan in the Showtime crime drama television series Dexter, which premiered its first season on October 1, 2006.</p><p>In the series, her character Debra is the adoptive sister of the title character, played by actor <a href=# rel=follow>Michael C. Hall</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The actress impressed several critics once again. The Australian journalist Jack Marx even described her character as "cool and clumsy" and "so perfect that many viewers appear to have mistaken the character's flaws for the actor's."</p><p>During a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">conversation with Paul Hirons</a> in 2009, she talked about her character’s relationship with the series’ central character, Dexter. She said both the characters anchored each other and would be out of balance without the other.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>“Dexter is her only tie to her family and without him that idea dies,” she said. “At first I think Debs sort of began as a disguise for Dexter, but now they’re sewn together.” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She also shared that the show earned her fans across the world, and she, at times, freaked out when people stared at her. She, however, prefers if her fans come to her and “say hi.”</p><p>“...otherwise I feel like I’m in high school and someone is just looking at me to see what I’m wearing,” she added.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>A 'Dexter' Revival on Showtime</h2><p>The series Dexter was concluded after its eighth season, which premiered back in September 2013.
