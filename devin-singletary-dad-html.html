He has been with the team since 2019. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>There is not much information about Devonn except for the fact that he also used to play football. He played&nbsp;college football&nbsp;at Norfolk State.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Devin Singletary.
