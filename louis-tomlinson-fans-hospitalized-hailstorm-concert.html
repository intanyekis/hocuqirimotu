The West Metro Fire Rescue said on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Facebook</a> that the hail was almost the size of a golf ball. The organization said nearly 100 people were injured, seven of whom went to the hospital with “non-life threatening injuries.” 80 to 90 people were treated for their injuries at the scene, West Metro Fire Rescue said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Due to the weather, Red Rocks Park and Amphitheatre initally <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>told</a>&nbsp;concertgoers that the show was going to be delayed. The venue advised everyone to “seek shelter in your vehicle,” and then they gave everyone the all clear, and said the show was getting ready to start, before the event was postponed because of the hail. “Please be safe exiting the amphitheatre – we’ll have more information for ticket holders soon,” Red Rocks said in a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tweet</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Louis-Tomlinson-Fans-Hospitalized-concert-ss-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Louis is on tour right now to support his new album Faith in the Future, which came out in November 2022.
