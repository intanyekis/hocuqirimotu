Getting from class to class at Caddo Hills High School had become a chore for the teenager.</p><p>"My arms would get really tired," Brandon told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">News9 TV</a>.</p><p>Tanner, who knew that his friend was struggling, spent two years working his part-time job at a local car mechanic shop to save enough money to buy Brandon <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an electric wheelchair</a>, his mother Colleen Carmack told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a>. Tanner gifted Brandon the wheelchair at school, sharing a lesson in kindness with his classmates.</p><p><strong class=punchline-large>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Heartwarming Footage Shows Dog Pushing Owner's Wheelchair</a></strong></p><p>Meanwhile, Brandon was overwhelmed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"They came in and my face just blew up," he told News9. "I was just crying everywhere. I was like, 'Wow I can't believe he did that for me.' It's been my dream to just have one of these. And my dream came true. He's just always been there for me.”</p><p>Tanner explained that he just wanted to show his friend that he cared since Brandon has always been there for him. Carmack told CNN that her son has been moved by all the media attention and is overjoyed when he reads online messages about his effort. She says the attention is well-deserved because they’re “both great and wonderful kids."</p><p>However,&nbsp;Carmack was not surprised by her son’s selflessness. She has tried to instill in him that you get nowhere by being self-centered. She says Tanner has endured some hardship over the past year, so being able to do something good for someone else has left him with a sense of accomplishment and a determination to continue doing for others.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We're talking about college.
