Regarding her romantic life, Jennifer Hudson has always played her cards close to the chest. In recent years, however, there have been rumors about who she may be dating.</p><p>When this topic is mentioned, two names immediately come to mind. Her co-star in the Aretha Franklin biopic Respect, Marlon Wayans, is the first. Wayans portrayed Ted White, Franklin’s spouse, while Hudson portrayed Franklin.</p><p>When videos and photographs of their rehearsals and on-set activities began to spread online, rumors about their connection began to emerge. People saw that they possessed exceptional chemistry and were excellent together in and out of character.</p><p>As the two began to appear in interviews together, whispers about their relationship persisted long after filming and advertising had begun. They remarked on how exceptional they were as personalities and coworkers.</p><p>Wayans frequently highlighted Hudson and how he attempted to de-stress her after long workdays by sending her to spas and such activities.</p><p>He also stated that kissing her in the film was comparable to kissing a cloud and that it was one of the most pleasant kisses he had ever experienced.</p><p>Furthermore, he acknowledges in one of his interviews that her voice turned him on. In one of his Instagram photos, when she posed with a poster for his HBO Max comedy special You Know What It Is, he even referred to her as “boo.”</p><p>Wayans’ advances toward Hudson were reciprocated by Hudson. She claimed that he would insist on cooking for her instead of her assistants, bring her chocolates on set since he knew she appreciated them, and send her on spa days.</p><p>Despite this, neither has posted about the other in a while nor have they appeared together since the movie’s marketing campaign concluded. Perhaps their romance was a mere fabrication. Will. I. Am was another person associated with Hudson.</p><p>This took place approximately three years before her relationship with Wayans. In early 2017, Hudson and Will. I. Am served as a judge on the United Kingdom version of The Voice. According to historical reports, they met on the scene and had a casual relationship.</p><p>Then, in January 2018, speculations circulated that their casual relationship had a high likelihood of becoming serious. This rumor also went quietly because nobody addressed it.</p><h2><span id=History_of_Jennifer_Hudson8217s_Family_and_Relationships>History of Jennifer Hudson’s Family and Relationships</span></h2><p>James Peyton was the first lover of Hudson. In 1999, when she was 18 years old, the couple began dating. Their relationship ended in 2007, and Hudson began dating someone else within a year.</p><p>David Otunga, a WWE superstar with a law degree from Harvard, courted her, and they began dating. Even more, in September 2008, they became engaged.</p><p>On August 10, 2009, Jennifer Hudson and Olunga had their first child, son David Otunga Jr. The couple was engaged, but Hudson constantly stated in interviews that she was in no hurry to tie the knot. However, their romance terminated before they could make significant wedding preparations.</p><p>The divorce was finalized in November 2017, and things have only gotten worse since then. When media outlets received a copy of her protective order request against Otunga, their separation became public knowledge.</p><p>She reportedly sought an injunction after he allegedly harassed and threatened her. In January of the following year, the courts expunged his record, although it was assumed they were fighting for legal custody of their child.</p><p>Unknown are the specifics of their custody dispute, although David Jr. appears to spend a great deal of time with his mother. He frequently visits her Instagram account.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Is Deadliest Catch&#39;s Josh Harris Wed?
