A Guide to the Filming Locations of the Zombie Apocalypse</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>The Walking Dead is one of the most popular and acclaimed television shows of all time, based on the comic book series by Robert Kirkman and Tony Moore. The show follows a group of survivors as they navigate a post-apocalyptic world overrun by zombies, or “walkers”, as they call them. The show has been praised for its realistic and gritty portrayal of the horror and drama of living in such a scenario, as well as its exploration of the human psyche and morality.</p><p>But where is Walking Dead shot? How do the producers create the convincing and immersive settings of the show? In this article, we will take a look at some of the filming locations of The Walking Dead, and how they contribute to the show’s aesthetic and atmosphere.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Atlanta, Georgia: The Beginning of the End</h2><p>The first season of The Walking Dead was filmed primarily in Atlanta, Georgia, where the show is set. Atlanta is the capital and largest city of Georgia, and a major cultural and economic hub of the southeastern United States. The city is known for its diverse and vibrant neighborhoods, its rich history, and its role in the civil rights movement.</p><p>In the show, Atlanta is depicted as a chaotic and dangerous place, where the zombie outbreak has caused widespread panic and destruction. The city is mostly abandoned, with only a few pockets of survivors and hostile groups. Some of the iconic scenes from the first season that were filmed in Atlanta include:</p><ul><li>Rick’s house: The house where Rick Grimes, the main protagonist of the show, lived with his wife Lori and son Carl before the apocalypse, is located in 817 Cherokee Ave SE, Atlanta, near the historic Grant Park and the zoo. The house is shown in the pilot episode, where Rick wakes up from a coma and finds his home empty and ransacked.</li><li>The hospital: The hospital where Rick was in a coma when the outbreak occurred, and where he first encounters the walkers, is the Atlanta Mission, a homeless shelter and recovery center in 165 Ivan Allen Jr Blvd NW, Atlanta. The hospital is shown in the pilot episode, where Rick escapes from the building and sees the corpses of the patients and staff outside.</li><li>The tank: The tank where Rick takes shelter from the walkers in the pilot episode, and where he meets Glenn, another survivor, is a replica of an M1 Abrams tank that was placed in the intersection of Forsyth St SW and Walton St SW, Atlanta. The tank is shown in the pilot episode, where Rick shoots his way through the horde of walkers and climbs into the tank.</li><li>The CDC: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where the survivors hope to find a cure or an explanation for the zombie virus, is the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre, a venue for concerts, shows, and events in 2800 Cobb Galleria Pkwy, Atlanta. The CDC is shown in the season finale, where the survivors meet Dr. Jenner, the last remaining scientist in the facility.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Senoia, Georgia: The Home of Alexandria</h2><p>Senoia, Georgia, is a small town in Coweta County, about 35 miles southwest of Atlanta. The town is known for its historic and charming downtown, its antebellum homes, and its film and television industry. Senoia has been the location for several movies and shows, such as Driving Miss Daisy, Fried Green Tomatoes, and Sweet Home Alabama.</p><p>Senoia is also the home of Alexandria, the walled community where the survivors find refuge and stability in the later seasons of The Walking Dead. Alexandria is a real neighborhood in Senoia, with real houses and residents. The neighborhood is surrounded by a 15-foot high metal wall that was built for the show, and is guarded by security personnel. Some of the scenes from Alexandria that were filmed in Senoia include:</p><ul><li>Rick’s house: The house where Rick and his family live in Alexandria is located in 20 Crook Rd, Senoia. The house is shown in several episodes, where Rick and his group adjust to the new environment and face various challenges and threats.</li><li>Deanna’s house: The house where Deanna Monroe, the leader of Alexandria, lives with her family, is located in 48 Morgan St, Senoia. The house is shown in several episodes, where Deanna and Rick clash over the direction and future of the community.</li><li>The church: The church where the residents of Alexandria gather for worship and meetings, is located in 72 Main St, Senoia. The church is shown in several episodes, where the survivors deal with moral and ethical dilemmas and conflicts.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Other Filming Locations: From the Prison to the Kingdom</h2><p>The Walking Dead has filmed in many other locations in Georgia, as the show has the survivors traveling from one place to another in search of safety and resources. Some of the other filming locations of The Walking Dead include:</p><ul><li>The prison: The prison where the survivors stay for two seasons, and where they face the threat of the Governor and his group, is the Raleigh Studios Atlanta, a film and television production facility in 600 Chestlehurst Rd, Senoia. The prison is shown in seasons 3 and 4, where the survivors fortify and defend the place from the walkers and the enemies.</li><li>The farm: The farm where the survivors stay for a season, and where they meet Hershel and his family, is the Raleigh Studios Atlanta, a film and television production facility in 600 Chestlehurst Rd, Senoia. The farm is shown in season 2, where the survivors cope with the loss of Sophia and the discovery of the barn full of walkers.</li><li>Terminus: Terminus, the supposed sanctuary that turns out to be a trap for the cannibalistic group of Gareth and his followers, is the Norfolk Southern Inman Yard, a rail yard and intermodal terminal in 781 Marietta St NW, Atlanta. Terminus is shown in seasons 4 and 5, where the survivors escape from the place and seek revenge on the cannibals.</li><li>The Kingdom: The Kingdom, the community that is ruled by King Ezekiel and his pet tiger Shiva, is the Fort McPherson, a former military base in 1788 Hardee Ave SW, Atlanta. The Kingdom is shown in seasons 7 and 8, where the survivors ally with the community and fight against the Saviors.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Conclusion</h2><p>The Walking Dead is a show that has captivated millions of viewers with its thrilling and compelling story of survival and humanity in a zombie apocalypse.
