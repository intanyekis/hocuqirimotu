When Rosie was quite young, her family moved to Las Vegas where a young Rosie grew up. She attended Bishop Gorman High School before moving on to the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. During her time in high school, Rosie struggled with her weight and was bullied because of it. As one of the five Latinos who attended the school, Rosie felt she didn’t fit in. She was often teased by her peers and was called names due to her weight. She graduated with a degree in Business Management from the University of Nevada.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Professional Career:</h2><p>Rosie always had a passion for fashion and entertainment, but she faced many challenges because of her weight. She was initially rejected by the industry for being too big. Rosie did not give up on her dreams. She started her career as a photographer, but she did not have enough money to hire professional models. She decided to take pictures of herself and send them to agencies and magazines. However, she was often told that she had a beautiful face but needed to lose weight. She was also discouraged by the lack of diversity and representation of plus-size women in the media.</p><p>Rosie’s breakthrough came in 2009, when she competed in the Miss Plus America Pageant. She was discovered by a celebrity photographer who encouraged her to pursue modeling. She also met other plus-size models who inspired her to embrace her curves and celebrate her beauty.
