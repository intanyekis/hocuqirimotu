For example, right now a lot of people can’t get enough of the Kardashians/Jenners, Smiths, or Levys and in the past, the Sheens, Fondas, and Coppolas cast big shadows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given that there have been so many famous families over the years, it makes sense that some of them don’t get much attention these days. For example, it has been a long time since the Brolin family has been a regular subject of headlines.</p><p>When most people imagine what it would be like to be related to a huge star, they likely envision enjoying all of the trappings of fame and fortune without the pressure. However, in reality, things often aren’t all they are cracked up to be. When it comes to Josh Brolin’s younger brother Jess, for example, most fans of the famed actor are likely to be surprised to learn about the headlines his sibling has garnered. Headlines aside, however, the real question is how is Jess doing on a day-to-day basis.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Celebrities Who Surprisingly Have Famous Parents</a></span></p><h2 id=a-megastar-family>A Megastar Family</h2><p>Since the late-60s, James Brolin has been a celebrated member of the Hollywood ecosystem. First made famous when he began starring in the medical drama Marcus Welby, M.D., James would go on to star in other shows like Hotel and Life in Pieces. On top of James’ television credits, he has starred in major movies like Westworld, The Amityville Horror, Traffic, and Catch Me If You Can among others.</p><p>In 1998, Barbra Streisand became an official member of the Brolin family when she married James and they have remained together ever since. One of those rare performers who’ve attained an incredible amount of success in the acting and music worlds, it is hard to overstate how much Streisand has accomplished. For example, Streisand has won two Oscars, ten Grammy Awards, five Emmy awards, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Amazingly enough, that is just a small sampling of the awards Streisand has earned over the years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite everything that his father and mother-in-law have accomplished during their careers, these days Josh Brolin is the most talked-about member of his family. A massive movie star, Josh has headlined an extremely long list of highly successful films including The Goonies, No Country for Old Men, True Grit, and Deadpool 2. On top of all those films, Josh’s most notable role to date is playing Thanos in two of the highest-grossing films of all time, Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Much Was Josh Brolin Paid For Thanos In The Avengers Films?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=garnering-headlines>Garnering Headlines</h2><p>Unlike the three members of the Brolin clan who have accomplished superstardom, there also are several members of the extended family that remain anonymous. For example, James' daughter <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Molly</a> has mostly avoided the spotlight and the same can be said for Barbara’s son Jason Gould. However, Jess Brolin, James’ other son and Josh’s younger brother found himself in the spotlight for negative reasons.</p><p>In late-2014, a paparazzo captured images of Jess Brolin walking the streets in the Californian city of Ojai. While that wouldn’t have been remarkable, Jess was captured on film taking things out of public <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">garbage bins</a> and the headlines that followed claimed he ate what he found. Considering that Jess Brolin’s family is so rich, with Barbra Streisand reportedly even spending a fortune on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cloning her dogs</a>, it shocked many to see Jess in such a state.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When asked about the pictures of Jess rummaging through the trash, a Brolin family representative quickly spoke about their attempts to try and help him. “We have offered help and support and we continue to do so. We love him very much and only want what is best for him.” Later the New York Daily News reported that someone close to the family told them that the photos of Jess had been entirely <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">misconstrued</a>. According to the source, Jess accidentally threw a bottle in the trash and then decided to retrieve it so he could place it in recycling instead.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Is Barbra Streisand's Son Jason Gould, And What Does He Do?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-major-update>A Major Update</h2><p>In the years since Jess Brolin found himself in the spotlight, he has avoided the unforgiving glare of the press. As a result, very little was known about how he was doing for many, many years. However, in early 2021 James Brolin was interviewed by Parade and was asked about his two kids that didn’t follow him into the entertainment business. Fortunately for everyone who’d been worried about Jess, James made it clear he is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">doing well</a>.</p><p>“My son Jess lives in a mountain town and runs a charity organization. Right now, he’s probably the happiest of us all. I know he’s been photographed collecting bottles and cans out of the trash, but all the money went to charity.”</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's What James Brolin Has Said About The Tragic Passing Of His Mom, Jane Cameron Agee</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8brbOrJ9mmqKkuaq60mafqKWVobK0v4ybqaismJq%2FbrbErKpo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
