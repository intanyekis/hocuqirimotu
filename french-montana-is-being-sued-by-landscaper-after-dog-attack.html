The employee alleges the dog was roaming freely, which they say Montana was aware of.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kourtney Kardashian Flaunts Her $1 Million Ring After Engagement With Travis Barker</a></span></p><p><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Radar Online </a>adds that the dog named in the lawsuit is a Tibetan Mountain Dog who has allegedly bitten others in the past. The lawsuit claims Montana was fully aware of the dog's violent tendency.</p><p>Levya is seeking financial compensation and lost earnings. The lawsuit alleges that the landscaper is currently unable to 'attend to his normal occupations', and this will affect his future earnings for the foreseeable future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The amount Levya hopes to earn in the lawsuit hasn't been released, nor have details on the extent of his injuries, though multiple reports claim they're severe. Radar adds that Montana hasn't responded to the lawsuit thus far.</p><p>This isn't the only time Montana has been sued for an incident involving one of his dogs. He's also faced legal troubles on multiple occasions for attacks caused by his German Shepherd, Zane.</p><p>In August 2018, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a> reported that Juan Lomeli, a former pool maintenance person for Montana, launched a lawsuit after her the rapper's German Shepherd bit him. The ex-employee said he had no issues with the dog in the six months he worked for Montana prior to the incident.</p><p>More recently, in 2019, Montana also faced a lawsuit from his former handyman, Daniel Banuelos, who was attacked by the German Shepherd while installing a security camera system in the celebrity's Calabasas home.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like the current lawsuit, this one also alleged that Montana was fully aware the animal had a history of violence. It accuses the musician of failing to take proper protective measures. Banuelos sued for injuries and lost earnings, though a dollar figure wasn't released.</p><p><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ace Showbiz</a> reports that Montana agreed to discuss a settlement, but the resolution wasn't made public. It's likely that he also privately settled the earlier case, though the result of the lawsuit has also not been publicized.</p><p>Montana isn't the only celebrity to be sued over a dog attack. In July, we reported that a former housekeeper for Chris Brown <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">launched a lawsuit against the rapper</a> after his Caucasian Shepherd Ovcharka, named Hades, attacked her at his Tarzana, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Los Angeles </a>property.</p><p>Perhaps more disturbing, the ex-employee alleges Brown and his entourage did little to assist her when she called for help. After the attack, she adds they tried to get rid of the evidence. The case remains ongoing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shaquille O'Neal Sells Florida Home For $11M, Half Of The Asking Price After 3 Years</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Toronto Sun</a>, <a href=#>Ace Showbiz</a>, <a href=#>TMZ</a>, <a href=#>Radar Online</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSzs7HNnJ9mpZ%2BjwaK6wGagrGWSmravs4ysrJ6cXZfGbrjAp5usm5GlsrN5wJ%2BrnqpdmbyoecCtq5qbm2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
