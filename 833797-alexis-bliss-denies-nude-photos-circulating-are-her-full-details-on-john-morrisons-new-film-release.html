The movie also stars Osric Chau (“Supernatural,” “Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn”), Quinton “Rampage” Jackson (“The A-Team”), Spencer Grammer (“Rick and Morty,” “Greek”), Kevin Sorbo (“Gods Not Dead”) and Lorenzo Lamas (“American Dad”).</p><p>The movie follows Boone (Morrison), a fame-seeking reality show bounty hunter, and his crew, Kat (Spencer Grammer), Denny (Osric Chau) and Jackson (Quinton Jackson) as they ‘Boone’ delinquent celebrities such as Kevin Sorbo. When Boone gets the news that his TV show is being cancelled he attempts to spike ratings and save his show by taking his crew to Mexico to arrest a real criminal. Things get complicated in Mexico after Boone’s crew gets arrested and Boone is faced with a decision between ambition and justice.</p><p>Boone: The Bounty Hunter was created by John Hennigan and written by John Hennigan, Josh Burnell, Franco Movsesian, and Jonathan Perkins. It was directed by Robert Kirbyson and produced by Hoplite Entertainment and Killon Street. You can check out the trailer in the video above.</p><p class=authors-note>I saw this in Chicago over the weekend at the showing Mundo did after C2E2. The movie is VERY good. I highly recommend you going out of your way to find it. If you can make your way to one of the screenings and see it in a theater I’d absolutely suggest you do.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwhJJsbnJvXZa5psTIrGSbpJmowG6wxKegnqtdo8KlsYypn6isn6h6pLXRnKylmaSeu6h5wKucZqCVp3qnwculZJ2dpJa2rb%2BMqKVmop%2Bdu265zqupoqufo8BuusSwZJ%2BhnKJ6s7HLnpisnQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
