He is best known for his role as the general manager of the Boston Celtics in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Ainge’s success in his career has played a significant role in amassing his current net worth.</p><p>As of late-2016, sources estimate his net worth at $10 million, primarily accumulated through a successful career in basketball. Ainge also briefly pursued professional baseball and coaching in basketball. With his continued role as an executive, his wealth is expected to grow further.</p><h3>Danny Ainge – $10 million Net Worth</h3><p>Danny attended North Eugene High School, where he excelled in both football and basketball, contributing to two consecutive state championships for the school’s basketball team in 1976 and 1977. Ainge was considered a top prospect in football, baseball, and basketball, and achieved the rare feat of being named a first team All-American in three sports. He later attended Brigham Young University, gaining popularity in the NCAA. Ainge concluded his senior year with prestigious awards such as the Eastman Award and the John R. Wooden Award, and set a record of scoring in double figures for 112 consecutive games during his college career.</p><p>In 1977, Ainge was drafted by the Toronto Blue Jays and reached the major leagues within two years. He primarily played as a second baseman, becoming the youngest player in Blue Jays history to hit a home run. After three years with the Blue Jays, he transitioned to a professional basketball career and was selected by the Boston Celtics in the 1981 NBA Draft, with the team buying out his contract from the Blue Jays.</p><p>Despite initial difficulties in adjusting to professional basketball, Ainge gradually improved his game and played a pivotal role in helping the Celtics secure the NBA title in 1984 and 1986. Known for his bold personality, he often engaged in exchanges with other players. In 1989, he was traded to the Sacramento Kings and subsequently to the Portland Trailblazers the following year. He became a favorite among Portland fans and helped the team reach the 1992 NBA Finals, where they ultimately lost to the Chicago Bulls. A free agent after the season, he then signed with the Phoenix Suns. His contributions helped the team achieve a 62-20 record and reach the NBA finals, only to be defeated by the Chicago Bulls again. Ainge decided to retire after the 1994-1995 season.</p><p>In 1996, Ainge assumed the role of head coach for the Phoenix Suns but later resigned to allocate more time to his family. In 2003, he was appointed as the Executive Director of Basketball Operations for the Boston Celtics. Ainge played a crucial part in the team’s restructuring in 2008 through the acquisition of Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen. This led to the Celtics holding the best record in the NBA during the 2007-2008 season at 66-16, earning Ainge the NBA Executive of the Year Award. In the same season, the Celtics secured the NBA Championship, leading to Ainge’s promotion to President of Basketball Operations.</p><p>In his personal life, Danny has been married to Michelle since 1979, and they have six children. His son Austin serves as the director of player personnel for the Boston Celtics. The Ainge family are active members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p><p><br>﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Facts</li><li>Filmography</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Danny Ainge</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$10 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>March 17, 1959</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Eugene, Oregon, U.S.</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6′ 5″ (1.96 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>79 kg</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>General Manager of the Boston Celtics</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Brigham Young University, North Eugene High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Michelle Ainge</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Austin Ainge, Ashley Ainge, Crew Ainge, Tanner Ainge, Taylor Ainge, Cooper Ainge</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Kay Ainge, Don Ainge</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>David Ainge, Doug Ainge, Laurie Ainge</td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=#>https://twitter.com/danielrainge</a></td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0014673/</td></tr><tr><td>Awards</td><td>NBA Executive of the Year Award, John R.
