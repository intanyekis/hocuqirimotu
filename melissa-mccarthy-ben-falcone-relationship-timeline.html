Both hail from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the state of Illinois</a>&nbsp;and the two actors have been together for over 13 years. However, they have both been working in the industry for much longer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>McCarthy had her breakout role in the early 2000s, on the hit TV show,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gilmore Girls</a>,&nbsp;and eventually&nbsp;went on to star in many&nbsp;notable comedies&nbsp;like&nbsp;Bridesmaids&nbsp;and&nbsp;Tammy,&nbsp;along with other major&nbsp;movie remakes, such as&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghostbusters</a>.&nbsp;Falcone, on the other hand, has had a quieter career...but a successful one nonetheless.&nbsp;While he starred&nbsp;alongside his wife in the film,&nbsp;Bridesmaids,&nbsp;Falcone has also worked behind the camera. He's written and produced many hit shows. This Hollywood duo is a force to be reckoned with.</p><p>Let's take a closer look at how the happy couple came to be and where they are now.</p><h2 id=they-met-at-an-improv-show><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>They Met At An Improv Show</span></h2><p>Prior to the couple making&nbsp;it big in Hollywood, Melissa & Ben met in 1998,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">while performing at an improv theater</a>&nbsp;in Los Angeles. The theater was called The Groundlings and, in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Falcone talked about their time doing improv together. A particular skit that the two of them wrote and performed together was all about a Bob Seger-themed holiday. Falcone mentioned that he and Melissa "just howled" with laughter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Famous Movie Scenes That Were Actually Completely Improvised</a></span></p><h2 id=worked-together-on-gilmore-girls><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Worked&nbsp;Together On Gilmore Girls</span></h2><p>With their improv days behind them, the two went on to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">act together for the first time</a> in the hit television series,&nbsp;Gilmore Girls. Melissa&nbsp;McCarthy played Sookie St. James, a chef, and&nbsp;Lorelai Gilmore's BFF. She was a beloved character who made frequent appearances in the series, which eventually wrapped up after 7 seasons.</p><p>Falcone, on the other hand, only made a one-time appearance on the TV show, in a season 3 episode called, "Say Goodnight, Gracie".&nbsp;In the episode, the two do share the screen together now and then.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gilmore Girls Premiered 20 Years Ago: Reasons To Rewatch It Now</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=melissa-amp-ben-say-i-do><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Melissa & Ben Say I Do</span></h2><p>After 7 years of&nbsp;being boyfriend and girlfriend,&nbsp;the comedic couple got hitched in the fall of 2005. In an interview with&nbsp;More&nbsp;magazine, the&nbsp;Life Of The Party&nbsp;actress and&nbsp;Bridesmaids&nbsp;actor talked about how they&nbsp;were made for each other: "From the very first time we spoke, we were on the same page. We love each other, respect each other, and try not to sweat the small stuff. And we really make each other laugh" said Falcone.</p><h2 id=their-family-grows-from-2-to-3><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Their Family Grows From 2 To 3</span></h2><p>Shortly before they hit the 2-year mark in their marriage, the happy couple welcomed their first child together. In January of 2007, McCarthy broke the news to&nbsp;People&nbsp;magazine. "We are so excited about the baby," she mentioned. "I’m hoping the baby has a lot of Ben’s calm traits and less of my spazzy ones." On May 5, 2007, McCarthy&nbsp;gave birth to baby girl, Vivian.</p><h2 id=couple-welcomes-baby-2><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Couple Welcomes Baby #2</span></h2><p>Not long after Vivian was born, Melissa gave birth to Vivian's younger sister, Georgette, on March 22, 2010. It was around this time that McCarthy was about to return to the television screen in the CBS sitcom, Mike & Molly.&nbsp;In fact, the very funny actress started filming the first season of&nbsp;Mike & Molly&nbsp;only 4 months after giving birth. Talk about a hustler!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-act-in-their-first-film-together><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>They Act In Their First Film Together</span></h2><p>In April 2011, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hit comedy, Bridesmaids</a><i>,&nbsp;</i>took to the big screen. While the film has many notable scenes and hilarious one-liners, no one can forget the iconic banter (and airplane scene) between McCarthy and Falcone. Melissa played the role of Megan, the bride-to-be's future sister-in-law, while Ben took on the character of an undercover air marshal named Jon.</p><p>Without spoiling too much, let's just say there are some hilarious attempts at flirting involved.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Bridesmaids Scenes Guaranteed to Make You LOL Every Single Time</a></span></p><h2 id=couple-starts-their-production-company><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Couple Starts Their Production Company</span></h2><p>A couple of years after the hit,&nbsp;Bridesmaids,&nbsp;debuted, Ben & Melissa started their very own comedy production company called On the Day Productions.&nbsp;When&nbsp;asked by&nbsp;The Hollywood Reporter&nbsp;about the new endeavour, McCarthy stated that it was a long time coming:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We've been writing together for longer than we've been married... [so] to be able to produce our own work and other people's work that we are so passionate about is really a dream come true." The company has produced films, including&nbsp;Tammy&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Boss.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=ben-publishes-a-book-about-fatherhood><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Ben Publishes A Book About Fatherhood</span></h2><p>After a few years of being a dad, Ben decided to take pen to paper and wrote a book about&nbsp;his&nbsp;dad. He also wrote about his own experiences being a father to his two daughters, Vivian and Georgette. Like any supportive spouse would do, McCarthy promoted the book via her social media channels and even wrote the foreword in the book. Now, that's serious #couplegoals if you ask us.</p><h2 id=they-return-to-television-together><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>They Return To Television Together</span></h2><p>It was only a matter of time until the duo returned to the small screen. In 2017, Ben & Melissa joined the cast of Nobodies,&nbsp;a TV Land comedy that was produced by various Groundlings alumni, including Hugh Davidson, Larry Dorf, and Rachel Ramras. <i>Nobodies&nbsp;</i>followed&nbsp;a group of friends working together on a children's show. But alas, all things must come to an end.&nbsp;Nobodies&nbsp;was eventually cancelled after its second season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=melissa-gifts-ben-devilled-eggs-for-valentine-s-day><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Melissa Gifts Ben Devilled Eggs For Valentine's Day</span></h2><p>It seems like it's never a dull moment with these two. For Valentine's Day in 2018, Melissa made a romantic gesture by gifting her hubby what seemed like a heart-shaped box of chocolates. However, it was in fact a box of devilled eggs.</p><p>Sharing the post on his official Instagram page, Falcone captioned the video:&nbsp; "Love is knowing I want devilled eggs more than chocolate. Thank you @melissamccarthy - Happy Valentine’s. Love you!" Guess McCarthy is a good gift giver after all?</p><h2 id=couple-makes-their-third-film-together><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Couple Makes Their Third Film Together</span></h2><p>Third time's a charm. With this couple, it seems like everything they create together ends up working out. In the same year as the infamous devilled egg gift, Falcone and McCarthy worked together on their third film,&nbsp;Life of the Party.&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the premiere, McCarthy expressed her gratitude for being able to work together with her husband: "It's ridiculous. It's like you get to go to work with your best friend," Melissa said to&nbsp;E! News.&nbsp;"It's exactly how we met and we became such good friends because we loved doing this together. To get to do it on this kind of scale and still keep telling stories…it's a dream."</p><h2 id=celebrate-13th-wedding-anniversary><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Celebrate 13th Wedding Anniversary</span></h2><p>While their marriage is arguably #goals, their 13th anniversary was maybe not what they had in mind. In an interview on&nbsp;Ellen, Melissa mentioned how the two had company during their anniversary celebration:</p><p>"We had a very romantic evening at our house…with Richard E. Grant [Melissa's costar in <i>Can You Ever Forgive Me?</i>] which I thought was kind of lovely," she said, laughing. "He found out on the way home." Maybe next anniversary, they go without the third wheel.</p><h2 id=couple-works-together-on-their-first-drama-film><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Couple Works Together On Their First Drama Film</span></h2><p>Can You Ever Forgive Me&nbsp;was McCarthy & Falcone's first ever drama they both starred in. Based on a true story,&nbsp;Can You Ever Forgive Me&nbsp;was about&nbsp;talented biographer, Lee Israel (played by McCarthy) who eventually turns to literary letter forging due to a declining career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ben plays the role of Alan Schmidt, a collector who is eventually recruited by the FBI in an attempt to expose her. The film went on to generate a lot of award buzz and McCarthy's impressive performance as Lee Israel led her to&nbsp;being nominated for a Golden Globe&nbsp;for "Best Actress in a Motion Picture" and an Oscar for "Best Actress".</p><p>While McCarthy didn't take any hardware home with her, we have a hunch that her time will come.</p><h2 id=they-wear-matching-tracksuits><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>They Wear Matching Tracksuits</span></h2><p>Even though the 2019 Oscars proved to be a loss for McCarthy (Glenn Close took the Oscar home that year), she and Ben didn't let that dampen their spirits. At the Vanity Fair Oscar's&nbsp;after-party, the comedy duo showed up in cool, yet casual attire - matching Adidas tracksuits.&nbsp;If that's not love, we don't know what is.</p><p><strong>Sources</strong>: IMDB, Women's Health, The List</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Secret To A Happy Marriage, According To These Celebrity Couples</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiknqSZqMCiecycmpqqpJ3Gbq7Ep2SfmZyYvK%2BxjKucpZmknryvv8eip2asmaKyrbXNnmY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
