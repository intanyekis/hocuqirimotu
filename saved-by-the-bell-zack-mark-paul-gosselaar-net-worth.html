An outpouring of love from longtime fans overflowed when news of "Screech" Dustin Diamond's untimely passing hit the airwaves recently.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though reboot plans have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fans suggesting ways that 'Saved by the Bell' can honor Screech</a>, it's unclear at this point how far the new show will go.</p><p>But commemorating the late actor also led to fans wondering what happened to the rest of the cast members of the teen sitcom. For many viewers who were growing up at the same time as Screech, Zack, Lisa, Slater, Jessie, and Kelly, the show was both deep and humorous, something that no other show had yet accomplished at the time.</p><p>Though former '90s star Mario Lopez is still very visible in Hollywood, Zack Morris, AKA Mark-Paul Harry Gosselaar, hasn't been quite as in-your-face over the years. What has he been up to, and, more interestingly, how much is he worth today?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Dustin Diamond Ended Up With A $500,000 Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fortunately for Mark-Paul, his sitcom run didn't end with the '80s-era show. In fact, he's part of the cast of the reboot, along with "Lisa," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lark Voorhies, whose comeback thrilled fans</a>. But in between the '80s and now, Gosselaar has kept plenty busy.</p><p>In fact, he had an 87-episode run on 'NYPD Blue' in the early 2000s, followed by a recurring role on 'Commander in Chief.' Then, he starred in 'Franklin & Bash,' and after that, there were two shorter series that totaled around 20 episodes.</p><p>Other show appearances (including some as himself) and movie roles popped up between his longer-running jobs, of course. But it would seem that Gosselaar's consistency in Hollywood has paid off; he's even a main cast member on 'Mixed-ish.'</p><p>As <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a> confirms, the actor's net worth is somewhere around $8 million. Arguably, his early days on the teen comedy didn't pad his pockets much. But such a famous and well-regarded role likely led to almost every other role the actor was offered afterward. So, fans could argue that Mark-Paul owes 'Saved by the Bell' most of his success.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As far as those millions, they didn't come directly from Mark-Paul's time as Zack. In fact, the actor revealed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">USA Today</a> that the cast earned no residuals from their time on the show. Unlike 'Friends' cast members, who continue to earn millions today, the original crew from 'Saved by the Bell' doesn't receive any leftover cash, noted Mark-Paul.</p><p>Plus, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mario Lopez once revealed that the cast only made around $3,500 an episode</a> for the show. If that figure is accurate, Mark-Paul and the rest of the lead actors only made a net income of around $300K for their hit show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The good news is, Mark-Paul had enough cash to buy a $2.3M home in 2014, and his impressive resume likely means there's more cheddar to come for the star.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mario Lopez Redoing The 'Barbara Ann' Dance Is The Best Thing Fans Have Seen On 'Saved By The Bell'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqmq6VmXqjxYytn55lkpq5rXnZmpqkZZ2Wv6x5z5qspWWXpMC0scuamKtlnprBbsPOq6uhZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
